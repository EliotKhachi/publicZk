# Core Basics First

The first thing you should cover when learning something new are the *core basics*.  

The core basics are significant and immediate understandings. They are the things you need to grasp before moving onto more complex 
or nuanced topics.  

1. First learn the things that "move the needle" the furthest. See [The Pareto Distribution / 80-20 Rule](../202110031839).  

2. After identifying a core skill / "know-how", test it in many different contexts. Try to answer questions with it. Find 
its limits and connections. You may be surprised at how far the core basics can take you.
