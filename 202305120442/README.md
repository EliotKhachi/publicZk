# Transistors 

A transistor is functionally similar to a relay.  

## NPN Transistor
An NPN transistor has 3 leads :  
1. Base  
2. Collector (+)  
3. Emitter (-)  

Normally, no electricity can close from the collector to the emitter...unless you apply a very small amount of current to the base. You can use a really weak battery to provide electricity for the base, or a bigger battery and include a large resistor.
