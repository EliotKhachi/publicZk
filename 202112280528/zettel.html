        <ul>
        <li><p>Imagine you give the "go" or "no-go" for a part to assembly. One of the parts, a pin, has a maximum and minimum diameter for its feature of size, as well as a position tolerance. The pin fits inside the gage you are using, and so you give it a "go" for assembly. But the part inspector measures the pin diameter and tells you that it exceeds its maximum size. What do you do? Who is right?</p></li>
        <li><p>You are both right. The purpose of a <em>zero position tolerance</em> is to resolve the dilemma of a part being out of specification according to the print, yet at the same time passing the <em>gage test</em> and receiving a "go" for assembly.</p></li>
        <li><p>If the pin is given a maximum diameter of the virtual condition and a position tolerance of exactly 0 at MMC, then any pin that passes the gaugage test will also meet its maximum diameter limit. The <em>same</em> gage is now a test for maximum diameter; however, the pin's minimum diameter must still be inspected.</p></li>
