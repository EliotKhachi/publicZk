# What is Kotlin? 

Kotlin is a *programming language* that is similar to Java and very easy to learn if you come from a Java background. It was designed to interoperate fully with Java; the JVM version of its standard library depends on the *Java Class* library, but *type inference* allows its syntax to be more concise.
