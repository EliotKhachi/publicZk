<h1 id="what-is-kotlin">What is Kotlin?</h1>
<p>Kotlin is a <em>programming language</em> that is similar to Java and very easy to learn if you come from a Java background. It was designed to interoperate fully with Java; the JVM version of its standard library depends on the <em>Java Class</em> library, but <em>type inference</em> allows its syntax to be more concise. <a href="../202210141859">202210141859</a> - Type Inference</p>
