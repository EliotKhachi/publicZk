# What is a Web Server?
---
**Hardware Side**
* A computer that stores web server software and website component files (HTML, CSS, Javascript, images)  
* Connected to the internet and supports physical data interchange with other devices on the web  
---
**Software Side**
* A software is required that understands *URLs* and *HTTP*.  

## Types of Web Servers
* **Static** - Web servers are *static* when the server sends its hosted files *as-is* to your browser.  
* **Dynamic** - Web servers are *dynamic* when the hosted files sent to the browser are constantly updating and changing. This requires extra software, known as the *application server* and *database*.  

## Example Server - Wikipedia
Consider the Website [Wikipedia.org](https://www.wikipedia.org/). It may seem just like a hyperlinked site with static documents, but it is likely a *dynamic* website. Due to its scale, it would be inefficient to store all its documents as static HTML files; this would make editing content difficult. Instead, a database is formed and maintained, and this data populates an HTML template.
