# What is a Web Server?
When using the term *web server*, we are either referring to hardware or software, depending on the context.  

If we're talking about hardware, we mean...  
* A computer that stores web server software and website component files (images, .html, .css, .js, etc.) and that is connected to the internet and supports physical data interchange with other devices on the web

If we're talking about software, we mean  
* The software that is required for the server and client [202206110302](../202206110302) to communicate, for example, Nginx --> [202206110217](../202206110217) - Deploy a Web Application Using Nginx

## Types of Web Servers
* **Static** - Web servers are *static* when the server sends its hosted files *as-is* to your browser.  
* **Dynamic** - Web servers are *dynamic* when the hosted files sent to the browser are constantly updating and changing. This requires extra software, known as the *application server* and *database*.  

## Example Server - Wikipedia
Consider the Website [Wikipedia.org](https://www.wikipedia.org/). It may seem just like a hyperlinked site with static documents, but it is likely a *dynamic* website. Due to its scale, it would be inefficient to store all its documents as static HTML files; this would make editing content difficult. Instead, a database is formed and maintained, and this data populates an HTML template.
