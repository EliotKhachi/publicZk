# Front-End Development

Front-End development of an application begins with the questions: *Where will my customers be consuming the application?*

## Mandatory Technologies
**Programming Language**
If the answer is on the web, almost always use JavaScript.
**UI framework** - A supplement to your language of choice. React is the most popular for JavaScript

## Optional Technologies
**State Management Software** - Helps scale your app.
**Editor Plugins** - make it easier to write code: makes CSS easier to use, simplify HTML, add syntax, purge un-used code: Sass, tailwindCSS, Bootstrap
**Module Bundler** --> Combines your javascript files into a bundle used by the browser
