        <p>Electricity is the flow of electrons.</p>
        <h2 id="the-water-analogy">The Water Analogy</h2>
        <p>Imagine a tank full of water with an open pipe connected to it and the water is draining out.</p>
        <p>This is analogous to connecting a battery's terminals together with a resistor/load in between.</p>
        <p><strong>Battery</strong> - The tank of water is our "battery".<br />
        <em>The bigger the tank, the higher the "voltage".</em></p>
        <p><strong>Voltage</strong> - Total water pressure is our "voltage" (don't think about the static and dynamic pressure components).<br />
        <em>Voltage is the "pressure" of electricity flowing through a wire.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Current</strong> - Volumetric flowrate is our "current".<br />
        <em>More flowrate equates to more current.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Resistance</strong> - The size of the pipe is our "resistance".<br />
        <em>The smaller the pipe, the higher the resistance.</em></p>
        <p>With these rules, a smaller pipe increases the resistance, which decreases the volumetric flowrate.</p>
        <h2 id="units">Units</h2>
        <p>Voltage (V) has units of volts (V)<br />
        Current (I) has units of amperes (A)<br />
        Resistance (R) has units of ohms (*horseshoe symbol*)</p>
