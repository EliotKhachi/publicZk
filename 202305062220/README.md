# Flow + Resistance

Electricity is the flow of electronics.  

## The Water Analogy 
Imagine a tank of water. 

## Connecting the Dots
* The tank of water is our "battery".  
* Water pressure is our "voltage". Voltage is the "pressure" of electronics flowing through a wire.   
* The Water volumetric flowrate is our "current".  

## Units
Voltage (V) has units of volts (V)
Current (I) has units of amperes (A)
