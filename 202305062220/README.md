# Flow + Resistance

Electricity is the flow of electronics.  

## The Water Analogy   
Imagine a tank full of water with an open pipe connected to it, causing the water to drain out.  

This is analogous to connecting a battery's terminals together with a resistor/load in between.  

**Battery** - The tank of water is our "battery".  
*The bigger the tank, the higher the "voltage".*  

**Voltage** - Total water pressure is our "voltage" (don't think about the static and dynamic pressure components).   
*Voltage is the "pressure" of electricity flowing through a wire.*   

**Current** - Volumetric flowrate is our "current".  
*More flowrate equates to more current.*  

**Resistance** - The size of the pipe is our "resistance".  
*The smaller the pipe, the higher the resistance.*  

With these rules, a smaller pipe increases the resistance, which decreases the volumetric flowrate.  

## Units
Voltage (V) has units of volts (V)  
Current (I) has units of amperes (A)  
Resistance (R) has units of ohms (O)
