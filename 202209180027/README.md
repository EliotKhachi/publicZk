# CRUD
The acronym CRUD stands for the four data operations:

* create  
* read  
* update  
* delete  

A **CRUD application** is any application that creates, reads, updates, and deletes data, which are most applications. However, with that being said, a *repository* doesn't need to support every operation to be a CRUD component. For example, Twitter's repository of tweets does not support deleting tweets.
