<h1 id="crud">CRUD</h1>
<p>The acronym CRUD stands for the four data operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>create<br />
</li>
<li>read<br />
</li>
<li>update<br />
</li>
<li>delete</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>CRUD application</strong> is any application that creates, reads, updates, and deletes data, which are most applications. However, with that being said, a <em>repository</em> doesn’t need to support every operation to be a CRUD component. For example, Twitter’s repository of tweets does not support updating tweets.</p>
