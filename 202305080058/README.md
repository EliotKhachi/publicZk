# Circuit Design, Build, and Measuring!

## Measuring Tips
* To measure voltage or resistance, the multimeter's probes can be placed in parallel with the circuit.  
* To measure current, the multimeter must be placed in series into the circuit.  
* When measuring current, first make sure your multimeter can handle it. Most multimeters can measure up to 10 amps, so if the circuit could be over 10A, don't even think about it! If you are confident the circuit is under 10A, use the 10A setting first. If the amperage is under 1A, you're going to get an inaccurate reading, but now that you now it's under 1A, you may use the mA setting without hurting your multimeter.
