# Verification and Validation

Systems need to be verified and validated to ensure the requirements at all levels are being met.

* **Verification** - Ensures you built the system right
	* Meets subsystem requirements through testing
	* Determines whether the computational model accurately represents the mathematical model
	* Scope is on the *elements*

* **Validation** - Ensures you built the right system
	* Meets system level requirements and stakeholder needs
	* Determines whether the model is an accurate representation of reality from the perspective of its intended use
	* Scope is on the *system*

## Examples
|Example|Verification or Validation?|
|--|--|
|Testing and handling of a new car in snow conditions in Alaska|Validation|
|Frontal crash test (of a car) in the lab|Verification|
|Testing of a new toy in a Kindergarten|Validation|
|Vehicle emissions testing on a dynamo|Verification|
|Satellite vibration testing on a shake table|Verification|
|Field testing of Google glasses with 1,500 pilot users|Validation|
