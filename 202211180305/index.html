<h1 id="mysql-inner-join">MySQL Inner Join</h1>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Given a CAD software / PLM database with the following tables: * engineer * assembly * component * assembly_component - <em>bridge table between assemblies and components (many-to-many relationship)</em></p>
<p>, return a result grid that links engineerâ€™s last names, their responsible assembly drawing numbers, and the components in those assemblies that are machined parts.</p>
<pre class="mysql"><code>/*
**Table Joining Concept**
Use common ids between the following tables in the following assembly:
engineer --&gt; assembly --&gt; assembly_component --&gt; component --&gt; filter 
*/
select
    engineer.last_name,
    assembly.assembly_id,
    component.name 
from engineer -- start with engineer table
inner join assembly on engineer.engineer_id = assembly.engineer_id -- join the assembly table using *engineer_id*  
inner join assembly_component on assembly.assembly_id = assembly_component.assembly_id -- join the assembly_item table using *assembly_id*
inner join component on assembly_component.component_id = assembly.component_id -- join the item table using *component_id* 
where component.component_type = &#39;Conventionally Machined&#39;; -- filter result</code></pre>
