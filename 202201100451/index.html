<ul>
<li>A turbopumpâ€™s function is to produce high-pressure fluid. In rocket propulsion, this fluid is propellant that is fed to a combustion chamber.</li>
</ul>
<p>A turbopump has main components: 1. A rotodynamic pump (impeller) 2. A driving gas turbine</p>
<p>, usually both mounted on the same shaft or geared together.</p>
<h2 id="two-types">Two Types</h2>
<p>There are two types of turbopumps: Centrifugal and Axial-flow 1. Centrifugal pump - Operates by throwing fluid outward at high-speed 2. Axial-flow pump - Alternating rotating and static blades progressively raise the pressure of a fluid.</p>
