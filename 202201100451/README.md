# Turbopump 

* A turbopump's function is to produce high-pressure fluid. In rocket propulsion, this fluid is propellant that is fed to a combustion chamber.

A turbopump has main components:
1. A rotodynamic pump (impeller)
2. A driving gas turbine  

, usually both mounted on the same shaft or geared together. 


## Two Types

There are two types of turbopumps: Centrifugal and Axial-flow
1. Centrifugal pump - Operates by throwing fluid outward at high-speed
2. Axial-flow pump - Alternating rotating and static blades progressively raise the pressure of a fluid.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

|	     | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------------|----------|----------|
| Centrifugal|Powerful when used with high-density fluids|Require large diameters when used with low-density fluids|
| Axial-flow |Have small diameters; Work well with low-density fluids|Multiple compression stages are needed; Modest pressure increases|
