# Product Development Cycle Meeting Format

A product development meeting occurs every one or two weeks, and it sets the cadence for the technical team to build and iterate on the product.  

1. **KPI** - Identify which KPI (that funnels into the top KIP, revenue) you will focus on improving this dev cycle.  
2. **Open brainstorm** - Everyone comes up with different ideas on what product improvements will move that KPI in the right direction. You can split product improvements into 3 categories: 1) New features / iterations on existing features, 2) bug fixes, and 3) A/B tests  
3. **Easy/Medium/Hard** - Rank each idea as easy, medium, or heard. Multiple easy ideas can be done in a single day. A medium idea can be done in 1-3 days. A hard idea will take one engineer over a week to build.  
4. **Decide** - Which product improvements are we going to build this cycle?  
5. **WRITE THE SPEC** - Really important. How are we actually building each thing? What would it look like?
