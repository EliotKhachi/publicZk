# Peripherals 

Devices such as computers and microcontrollers have *peripherals*, which are used to communicate with the outside world [2]. In general, the concept of what is a *peripheral* is somewhat fluid [1].

1. For sake of example, a computer may have the following peripherals:
	* Monitor
	* Keyboard
	* Mouse
	* Microphone
	* Camera

The keyboard or mouse are *external* peripherals; they are also peripheral devices that may be classified as *input* devices. The monitor, microphone, and camera are *internal* peripherals and can be considered *output* devices.

2. A microcontroller may have asome of the following peripherals:
	* Serial Communication Interfaces (SCI) like RS-232, RS-422, RS485, etc
	* Synchronous Serial Communication Interface like I2C, SPI, SSC, and ESSI
	* Universal Serial Bus (USB)
	* Multi Media Cards (SD Cards, Compact Flash, etc)
	* Networks like Ethernet
	* Fieldbuses like CAN-Bus, LIN-Bus, PROFIBUS, etc
	* General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO)
	* ADC or DAC
	* Debugging ports like JTAG, SWD, ST-Link, ISP, ICSP, BDM Port, BITP, DP9 etc

*Peripherals* that function as *outputs* are not always *internal*, nor are *peripherals* that function as *inputs* always *external*.
