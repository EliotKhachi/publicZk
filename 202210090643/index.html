<h1 id="domain-layer">Domain Layer</h1>
<p>An application’s <strong>domain</strong> is its real-world problem space.</p>
<p>It includes the nouns and verbs used to describe core concepts and defines relationships between concepts.</p>
<p>This is the most important application layer, assuming we can confidently handle the UX (user experience) and data management issues.</p>
<p>The domain doesn’t care where the data used to represent these nouns and verbs comes from. That’s a problem for the data access layer to handle.</p>
