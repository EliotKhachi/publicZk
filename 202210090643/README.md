# Domain Layer

An application's **domain** is its real-world problem space.  

It includes the nouns and verbs used to describe core concepts and defines relationships between concepts.  

 This is the most important application layer, assuming we can confidently handle the UX (user experience) and data management issues.  

The domain doesn't care where the data used to represent these nouns and verbs comes from. That's a problem for the  data access layer to handle.
