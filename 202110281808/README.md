# What is RF (radio frequency)? 

RF is a type of signal whereby electromagnetic radiation is used for transferring information between two circuits that have no direct electrical connection [1].

More specifically, RF stands for *radio frequency*. It is "the oscillation rate of an alternating electric current (AC) or voltage or of a magnetic, electric or electromagnetic field of a mechanical system in the frequency range from about 20 KHz to 300 GHz". These are the frequencies at which energy from an RF current in a conductor can radiate into space as *radio waves* [2].
