<h1 id="what-is-rf-radio-frequency">What is RF (radio frequency)?</h1>
<p>RF is a type of signal whereby electromagnetic radiation is used for transferring information between two circuits that have no direct electrical connection [1].</p>
<p>More specifically, RF stands for <em>radio frequency</em>. It is “the oscillation rate of an alternating electric current (AC) or voltage or of a magnetic, electric or electromagnetic field of a mechanical system in the frequency range from about 20 KHz to 300 GHz”. These are the frequencies at which energy from an RF current in a conductor can radiate into space as <em>radio waves</em> [2].</p>
