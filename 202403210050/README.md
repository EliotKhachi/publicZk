# Learning Blockchain

1. Know the opportunity of blockchain [[Read Write Own: Building the Next Era of the Internet](../202403202200)]  
2. Know the [Major Use Cases of Blockchain](../202403210052) 
3. Know what kind of blockchain developer you want to be (Application Dev or Core / Infrastructure Dev).  
4. **What programming languages to learn? What blockchain should I use?** Solidity - primary language to build smart contracts with Ethereum (Ethereum has over 50% of the value in blockchains)  
5. **Other tools to learn**:  
* [Hardhat framework](https://hardhat.org/)- Helps you build and test smart contracts locally for development.  
* [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org)- A workspace / online IDE to experiment with smart contracts on your browser.  
* [EthersJS](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) - Must-know Javascript library that lets you interact with smart contracts with built-in authentication using client-side private-keys.  
* [Metamask](the://metamask.io/) - A browser extension that gives you a wallet that enables you to connect to blockchains. You need a wallet to connect to / sign any blockchain.  
* [ReactJS](../202212310014)  
* [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)  
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)  
6. Step by Step Process
    * Go use a blockchain and gain some familiarity with the user experience. Install Metamask and use uniswap. Buy an NFT on OpenSea.  
    * Do a [lightweight tutorial project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4blK6X-D_4) that covers smart contracts with solidity and how the front-end interacts with it.  
    * Tackle a big project with no guidance. Add features little by little.
