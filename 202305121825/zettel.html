        <p>An Integration Circuit (IC) is a small circuit packaged up into a small component with a number of leads. The functions of ICs vary widely.</p>
        <p>They can be installed onto your circuit in one of two ways:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>ICs with Dual In-line Packaging (DIP) are made to go on breadboards.</li>
        <li>ICs with Surface Mount Packaging are meant to be soldered onto PCBs.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
        <p>All the pins of an IC are numbered. They are numbered <code>1</code> through <code>N</code>-- where <code>1</code> is the pin at the top-left corner of the IC, and each pin up to <code>N</code> is assigned by moving counter-clockwise from <code>1</code>.</p>
        <p>The top of the IC is indicated by an indentation on the IC body. Looking down on the IC, move counter-clockwise to assign the other pin #s.</p>
