# Integrated Circuits: 555 Timer

An Integration Circuit (IC) is a small circuit packaged up into a small component with a number of leads. The functions of ICs vary widely.  

They can be installed onto your circuit in one of two ways:  
1. ICs with Dual In-line Packaging (DIP) are made to go on breadboards.   
2. ICs with Surface Mount Packaging are meant to be soldered onto PCBs.
