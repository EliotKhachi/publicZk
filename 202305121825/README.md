# Integrated Circuits  

An Integration Circuit (IC) is a small circuit packaged up into a small component with a number of leads. The functions of ICs vary widely.  

They can be installed onto your circuit in one of two ways:  
1. ICs with Dual In-line Packaging (DIP) are made to go on breadboards.   
2. ICs with Surface Mount Packaging are meant to be soldered onto PCBs.  

## Structure
All the pins of an IC are numbered. They are numbered `1` through `N`-- where `1` is the pin at the top-left corner of the IC, and each pin up to `N` is assigned by moving counter-clockwise from `1`.  

The top of the IC is indicated by an indentation on the IC body. Looking down on the IC, move counter-clockwise to assign the other pin #s.
