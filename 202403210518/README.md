# Class C Missions

Class C missions are lower national significance, exploratory, or experimental missions, with a reduced set of mission assurance standards, reslulting in a **moderate risk profile**. 

## Characteristics
* Low cost  
* Moderate to low complexity  
* Reduced mission scope, shorter mission life  
* Mixture of cost plus and fixed price contracting   
* Few launch constraints and some alternative mission solutions available

## Mission Assurance Processes
**Requirements Analysis and Validation**  
* Model based requirements  
* Trace requirements to extent that development risk is mitigated  
**Design Assurance**  
* Develop architecture, conduct model-based analyses to extent that development risk is mitigated  
* Leverage model for key trades  
**Integration, Test & Evaluation**  
* Create internal block diagrams to extent that development risk is mitigated  
* Track verification of interface and system requirements
**Software Assurance**  
* Same as [Class A ](../202403210455), for software development heavy programs  

## Examples
* Comm/Nav Outages Forecasting System (CNOFS) sponsored by space test program, w/ payload suite provided by Air Force Research Lab.  
* Explorer payloads  
* ISS complex sub-rack payloads
