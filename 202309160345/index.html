<p><strong>Amazon ECR</strong> (Elastic Container Registry) is where you store your docker images so they can be run by ECS or Fargate.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon ECS</strong> (Elastic Container Service) is used to launch docker containers on aws. ECS takes care of starting / stopping containers, but you must provision and maintain the infrastructure (EC2 instances) with a different service [<a href="../202309152017">AWS Auto Scaling Group (ASG)</a>].</p>
<p><strong>AWS Fargate</strong> is used to launch docker containers on AWS, but it is a serverless offering. You do not need to manage any EC2 instances.</p>
