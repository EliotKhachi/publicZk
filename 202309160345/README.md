# Amazon ECS

Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) is used to launch docker containers on aws. ECS takes care of starting / stopping containers, but you must provision and maintain the infrastructure (EC2 instances) with a different service [[AWS Auto Scaling Group (ASG)](https://github.com/EliotKhachi//publicZk/tree/main/202309152017)].
