# Admin and Good For You

When learning something, you will undoubtedly come **admin** knowledge, i.e. knowledge that an administrator or secretary needs. [Admin Definition](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/admin)

Admin knowledge is any small thing that is holding you back from grasping the main concepts and learning the important stuff. You can and should tackle these details 
at a later time. Admin knowledge can be *less important* or just *hard for you* to grasp at this point in time. A great example of admin knowledge (for me) is vocabulary.  

You will also come across **good-for-you** knowledge.

Good for you knowledge is *unimportant*. It's up to you whether you'd like to learn it. It can even be completely *irrelevant*. On the other hand, it can be unimportant knowledge 
that *peaks your interest*, and that you would like to learn anyway.

Since everyone is different and some things are best learned before others, you must take charge of sifting through information best suited for you at various stages of the learning process.
