# Class A Missions

Class A missions are extremely critical operational systems where all practical measures are taken to ensure mission success. **Lowest risk profile that is practical**  

## Characteristics
* High cost  
* High complexity  
* Long mission life (> 10 years)  
* Cost plus contracts  
* Tight launch constraints 

# Mission Assurance Processes
**Requirements Analysis and Validation**  
* Requirement traceability at every level  
* Trace requirements to test cases
**Design Assurance**  
* Create all classic diagrams to unit level  
* Conduct model based analyses
**Integration, Test & Evaluation**  
* Model all mechanical and electrical interfaces via internal block diagrams  
* Track verification of interface and system requirements  
**Software Assurance**  
* Implement CI/CD unit testing for all software and firmware  
* Model hardware software interfaces via an internal block diagram  

## Examples
* Hubble Space Telescope
* GPS satellite  
* Military communication satellite systems
