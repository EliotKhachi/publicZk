# Facility Requirements Document

The facility requirements document, sometimes referred to as the statement of work in the case of out-of-house test facilities, defines the capabilities needed by the test facility to successfully perform the test.  

It varies widely based on the system being tested, but generally speaking it specifies:  
1. Facility interfaces and capabilities; i.e. can the facility provide sufficient power / fluid / data transfer speeds, etc, to perform the test and obtain the necessary data.  
2. Any test equipment necessary for installing the test article and performing the test, i.e. fixturing, data acquisition systems, power generators, pumps, etc.  
3. System safety concerns the facility ought to be aware of, and recommended precautions, i.e. PPE, but ultimate authority over safety guidelines and procedures are determined by the test facility.  
4. Data handling requirements for data downloads, transfers, and segregation of information (depends on the program's security guidelines, whether it be a classified test program or just proprietary)
