        <p>The <em>internet</em> is essentially a globally-connected medium through which information, or data, is exchanged.</p>
        <p>Its <strong>physical reality</strong> consists of billions of machines that have network connections to each other via ethernet or Wi-Fi. The methods and channels of communication have been standardized over the years. For example, The network port "80" is generally used to <em>request</em> (client) and <em>serve</em> (server) web pages. And web pages are transmitted in HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) . <em>Clients</em> are referring to the machines that are requesting to view the web pages. <em>Servers</em> are referring to the machines that are sending over the web page content.</p>
        <p>Me, you, and the average Joe are the clients. We access the internet, through our home modem and router, whenever we navigate to Instagram, Meta, or TikTok on our computer, laptop, or smart phone.</p>
