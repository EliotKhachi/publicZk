# The Role of Confidence in Leadership

Good leaders are confident that the path they're on will be a fruitful one, and they inspire others to share that vision and come along.  

Confident people know where they're going and why, but they don't necessarily know each step along the way. *Great* leaders are aware of gaps in their knowledge and the uncertainty in the future, and they move forward despite them, plan for them, driven by their vision.
