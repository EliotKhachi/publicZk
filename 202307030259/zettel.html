        <p>Good leaders are confident that the path they're on will be a fruitful one, and they inspire others to share that vision and come along.</p>
        <p>Confident people know where they're going and why, but they don't necessarily know each step along the way. <em>Great</em> leaders are aware of gaps in their knowledge and the uncertainty in the future, and they move forward despite them, plan for them, driven by their vision.</p>
