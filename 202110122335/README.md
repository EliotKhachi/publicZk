# The Bernoulli Equation

The Bernoulli Equation is a tool used to analyze steady, inviscid, incompressible flow. It states that the total pressure remains constant between any two points on a given streamline that satisfies the aforementioned assumptions. 


The total pressure is the sum of the static, dynamic, and hydrostatic pressures:

p_total = p_static + p_dynamic + p_hydrostatic = p + 1/2ρv^2 + γz
