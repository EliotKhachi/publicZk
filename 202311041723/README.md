# Hypervisor

A hypervisor is a piece of software that is used to create and manage virtual machines. It serves as an abstraction layer that sits on top of the physical computer's host operating system.  

## Limitations
* Hypervisors can only create virtual machines of the same OS as the host OS of the physical computer it's running on.
