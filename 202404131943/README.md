## Productivity
Makers' schedules are completely different from managers' schedules [[1]](https://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html). Makers need large blocks of time to think through difficult, complicated problems and make progress towards a solution. Managers, on the other hand, have problems that can be solved or questions that can be answered through a quick chat with a team member or an email, which takes 5-20 minute increments to make progress. It's important for managers to understand and respect this difference in work, and be careful not to interrupt their technical employees.
