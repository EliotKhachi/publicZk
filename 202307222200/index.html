<h2 id="adult-attachment-theory">Adult Attachment Theory</h2>
<p>Adult attachment theory poses that there are three attachment styles a person can exhibit in a romantic relationship: Secure, Anxious and Avoidant.</p>
<p><strong>Secure</strong> - Warm and loving. Is comfortable with closeness and intimacy. Expects to be loved.<br />
<strong>Anxious</strong> - Craves intimacy. Is often pre-occupied thinking about the relationship. Worries about their partner loving them back.<br />
<strong>Avoidant</strong> - Equates closeness with a loss of independence. Constantly tries to moderate closeness.</p>
<p>Studies show that attachment styles can be observed as early as infancy.</p>

<p>Attachment theory frames things nicely, but it is hard to label yourself as completely secure, anxious, or avoidant. Some of your behavior patterns may be secure, others may be anxious or avoidant. Through exercises and readings, you begin to notice your own behavior patterns and learn how to adopt more secure ones. For example, in one exercise you think about your past relationships, and uncover cues that led to insecure reactions.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The book <em>Attached</em> equips you with the knowledge and understanding of Adult Attachment Theory. With this toolkit, you can better navigate the dating world or your current romantic relationship!</p>
