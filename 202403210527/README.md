# Class D Missions

Class D missions have low national criticality and tend to be experimental with minimum mission assurance requirements and a **higher risk profile**.  

## Characteristics
* Low cost  
* Low complexity  
* Very short mission life (1 year or less)
* Minimum launch constraints and opportunities for alternative mission solutions  

## Mission Assurance Processes
**Requirements Analysis and Validation**
* If developing requirements, pursue model-based requirements  
**Design Assurance**  
* Conduct model-based analyses to extent that interfaces and safety are understood  
* Maintain software verification matrix (if applicable)  
**Integration, Test & Evaluation**  
* Create internal block diagrams to extent that interfaces and safety are understood  
**Software Assurance**
* Same as Class A, for software development heavy programs  

## Examples
* MidStar space vehicle developed by Naval Academy  
* CubeSats produced by universities  
* Simple ISS payloads
