# Reason to issue ECOs  

* ECOs are necessary to keep a record of previous iterations to make it easier to look back at a previous design or methodology for reference or to resort back to if the current design or process is unsatisfactory.

* By leaving a trail of documentation, this also lets stakeholders know that the business is actively resolving issues and making improvements.
