<h1 id="what-is-a-container">What is a Container</h1>
<p>A <em>container</em> is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.</p>
<p>When a container host like Docker runs a container, it tells the operating system to disconnect the container’s file system, network, and other OS resources as if they don’t exist. Then, it selectively reconnects a virtual file system, network, and OS resources.</p>
<p>From the container’s point of view, this simplified world is all that exists.</p>
