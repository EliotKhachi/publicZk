# What is a Container 

A *container* is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. 

When a container host like Docker runs a container, it tells the operating system to disconnect the container's file system, network, and other OS resources as if they don't exist. Then, it selectively reconnects a virtual file system, network, and OS resources.

From the container's point of view, this simplified world is all that exists.
