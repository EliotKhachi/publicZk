# Hypothesis on MBSE Organizational Shift

A model-based enterprise must be built by software engineers throughout the organization internally using software libraries, frameworks, SDKs, etc.. The reason why MBSE adoption has been slow and we haven't been seeing the "digital transformation" as promised is because we don't have software engineers dedicated to building models and developing MBSE workflows. Instead, we're relying on our systems engineers to use licensed GUIs with external IT support.  

Organizations that would like to employ MBSE need to take ownership of building the digital thread at a lower level. We just need to provide the organization the proper tools to make that feasible; for example, IDE plug-ins and visualizations, SDKs, frameworks, libraries, etc.. This gives the organizations flexibility and agility.
