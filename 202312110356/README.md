# Hypothesis on MBSE Organizational Shift

MBSE will be implemented by software engineers throughout the organization internally using an SDK. The reason why MBSE adoption has been slow and we haven't been seeing the "digital transformation" as promised is because we don't have software engineers dedicated to building models and developing MBSE workflows. Instead, we're relying on our mechanical engineers and analysts to learn and use licensed modeling software with external IT support.  

Organizations that would like to employ MBSE need to take ownership of building the digital thread themselves. We just need to provide the organization the proper tools, i.e. an SDK. The SDK would provide at least the same functionality as the current state of the art, but is more flexibile in nature.
