# Application Tiers

A application *tier* refers to a portion of an application that requires compute and/or data retrieval.  

For example, one application tier of Netflix may be serving the page content with your feed of video thumbnails. Another application tier is playing the video you hover over your mouse over. A third tier is serving and processing the full video you click on.
