# EC2 Instance Store

An *EC2 instance store* is a high-performance disk that is *physically* attached to an EC2 instance. Instance store is ideal for quick read/write storage, such as temporary  information that changes quickly, i.e. buffers, caches, and scratch data.  

*Note: Instance store is lost if our instance is stopped or terminated.*
