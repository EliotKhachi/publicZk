<p>An <em>EC2 instance store</em> is a high performance disk that is attached to our EC2 instance. Instance store is ideal for temporary storage of information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content.</p>
<p>RISK: Instance store is lost if our instance is stopped or terminated.</p>
