<h1 id="dynamic-pressure">Dynamic Pressure</h1>
<p>The dynamic pressure of a fluid can be thought of as the kinetic energy per volume of the fluid and is measured as the pressure that the fluid <em>would</em> exert if its kinetic energy were converted into pressure. For example, if a small tube is inserted into and faces upstream a flow, then the entry point into that small tube is called a stagnation point because the velocity of the flow at that point is 0. The stagnation pressure is greater than the static pressure by an amount equal to the dynamic pressure.</p>
<p>Definition of dynamic pressure: <strong>q = 1/2ρv^2</strong> –&gt; units: F*L/L^3 or F/L^2</p>
