# Dynamic Pressure 

The dynamic pressure of a fluid can be thought of as the kinetic energy per volume of the fluid and is measured as the pressure that the fluid *would* exert if its kinetic energy were converted into pressure. For example, if a small tube is inserted into and faces upstream a flow, then the entry point into that small tube is called a stagnation point because the velocity of the flow at that point is 0. The stagnation pressure is greater than the static pressure by an amount equal to the dynamic pressure.

Definition of dynamic pressure: **q = 1/2ρv^2** --> units: F\*L/L^3 or F/L^2
