# Potentiometers

## What is it
A potentiometer is an electrical component that usually has 3 leads and a knob. The knob moves a *wiper* inside the potentiometer that connects the outer leads to the middle lead. The location of the wiper changes the distance between an outer lead and the middle lead connection, thereby changing the resistance.   

A potentiometer is essentially a variable [resistor](../202305071844). By turning the knob, you're able to change the resistance of the potentiometer.
