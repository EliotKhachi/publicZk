        <h2 id="one-to-many"><strong>One-To-Many</strong></h2>
        <p>In a <em>one-to-many</em> relationship, a row in one table is related to zero or more rows in another table; the relation flows in one direction. To create a one-to-many relationship, the primary key of the "one" table is added as a <strong>foreign key</strong> to the "many" table.</p>
        <p>e.g. One hunter kills many animals, One rock band has many fans, One author has many books.</p>
        <h2 id="many-to-many"><strong>Many-To-Many</strong></h2>
        <p>In a <em>many-to-many</em> relationship two or more concepts come together and there is a relationship in both directions.</p>
        <p>e.g. Each sibling in a group of brothers and sisters have multiple brothers and sisters, Many fans support more than one rock band, Many books are written by more than one author.</p>
        <p><em>As you can tell, whether you use a one-to-many relationship or many-to-many relationship depends on not just the concept of the table, but the context of the database.</em></p>
        <h2 id="one-to-one"><strong>One-To-One</strong></h2>
        <p>In a <em>one-to-one</em> relationship, a separate table is created to extend the concept or refine the details of the original table. This separate table stores an attribute that otherwise would have left the original table <em>impure</em> conceptually [<a href="../202211210439/zettel.html">Normalization</a>].</p>
        <p>e.g. Product:Taxation Category, Customer:Contact Information</p>
