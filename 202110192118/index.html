<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Mode R</strong> - Mode Register - This register allows you to set any GPIO port and pin to a particular mode. There are 4 modes denoted by 2 bits XX (The first X is <em>called</em> bit 1 and the second X is <em>called</em> bit 0. This is to be distinguished from what <em>value</em> (0 or 1) the bits actually hold.
<ul>
<li>Input Mode (reset state): XX = 00 (bit 1 = 0, bit 0 = 0)</li>
<li>General purpose output mode: XX = 01 (bit 1 = 0, bit 0 = 1)</li>
<li>Alternate function mode: XX = 10 (bit 1 = 1, bit 0 = 0)</li>
<li>Analog mode: XX = 11 (bit 1 = 1, bit 0 = 1)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Otype R</strong> - Output Type - Determines whether the pin is open drain or push/pull . There are 2 modes denoted by 1 bit X. Bits 15:0 in the register can be configured, Bits 31:16 are reserved and must be kept at reset value.
<ul>
<li>Open Drain - X = 1</li>
<li>Push/Pull - X = 0</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>OSpeed R</strong> - Output Speed. Determines the speed of the signal (clock frequency?). There are 3 modes denoted by 2 bits XX (The first X is <em>called</em> bit 1 and the second X is <em>called</em> bit 0. This is to be distinguished from what <em>value</em> (0 or 1) the bits actually hold.
<ul>
<li>Input Mode (reset state): XX = 00 (bit 1 = 0, bit 0 = 0)</li>
<li>Low Speed - XX = X1 (bit 1 = 0 or 1, bit 0 = 1)</li>
<li>Medium Speed - XX = 01 (bit 1 = 0, bit 0 = 1)</li>
<li>High Speed - XX = 11 (bit 1 = 1, bit 0 = 1)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>PUPUDR</strong> - Pull-up/Pull-down Register. There are 3 modes denoted by 2 bits XX.
<ul>
<li>No pull-up, pull-down - XX = 00</li>
<li>Pull-up - XX = 01</li>
<li>Pull-down - XX = 10</li>
<li>Reserved - XX = 11</li>
</ul></li>

</ol>
<p>To turn on any given pin, set the <em>set</em> bit to 1 for that pin. To turn off any given pin, set the <em>reset</em> bit to 1 for that pin.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>BRR</strong> - Bit Reset Register - 16 total bits. Acts just like the <em>set</em> register on the <strong>BSRR</strong>.</li>

<p><strong>RCC</strong> - Reset Clock &amp; Control - This register controls a few buses located on the processor. The <strong>RCC</strong> is used to enable certain buses and their clocks. For instance, the <strong>AHB</strong> (Advanced High Performance Bus) can be enabled through the <strong>AHBENR</strong> register, which is under the <strong>RCC</strong>.<a href="../202110200251">RCC: C Code Example Using AHB to Enable GPIO Clock for Port C</a></p>
