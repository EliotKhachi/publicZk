# Linking a Program into a Binary

To link our program to a *binary* [\[Executable Binary File\]](../202202101926) we need a *linker script* [\[Linker Script\]](../202202102126). Part of what the linker script does is copy our program's contents into the correct addresses of MCU memory. We can retrieve the address ranges for our particular MCU in its data sheet by searching for its Memory Map [\[Memory Map of a Microcontroller\]](../202202101936).
