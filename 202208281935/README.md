# What is React? 

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. A React application is structured into pieces of code called *components*.

Intead of separating *technologies* by putting markup (HTML and CSS) and logic (JavaScript) in separate files, React separates *concerns* with loosely coupled units called *components* that contain both. [Wikipedia - Separation of Concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)
