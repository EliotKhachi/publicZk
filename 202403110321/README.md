# NAS Build

*NAS* stands for Network-Attached Storage. A NAS is used to extend data storage beyond your computer, while maintaining quick and frequent access to that data. For this project, I'll be building a NAS to store large amounts of media content such as videos and images and syncing it to a Google Drive. Ideally, it will be fast enough to read/write directly, rather than first downloading the content to a local drive, such as an SSD.  

We're on a tight budget, so we'll be using open-source software and extra hardware.
