          <h2>What is a Zettelkasten?</h2>
          <p>
            Zettelkasten is German for "slip box". It's a note-taking system
            designed and used by the German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. He
            needed a system to help him manage vast amounts of information and
            be a source for generating innovative ideas.
          </p>

          <p>
            The problem with traditional note-taking is that it leads to
            fragmented and cluttered information. You fragment information when
            you box in ideas (folders) and thereby isolate them. You clutter
            information when you have more folders than you can handle and don't
            know where to put what. The reality is that concepts overlap and
            intertwine and can't be categorized in just one way. Luhmann
            believed that to truly understand complex subjects, you need a
            system that encouraged an interplay of ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            In essence, a Zettelkasten is a living and breathing network of
            notes; a web of knowledge; a second brain. Each note can be linked
            to others, allowing for the emergence of unexpected connections,
            patterns, and insights, making it an invaluable tool for research,
            writing, and personal growth. Ideally, each note is atomic. The
            concept of atomicity in this context means there is one and only one
            idea being expressed per note. This makes each note complete in and
            of itself, thereby grounding it. Such notes can now serve as the
            foundation for other, more complex ideas. This system of note-taking
            grows organically without maintenance because...
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Each note can stand alone with the opportunity to be linked.
            </li>
            <li>
              Those that are linked infrequently are lost in the Zettelkasten
              and are forgotten.
            </li>
            <li>
              Those that are linked often will continue to come up and are the
              ones worth remembering.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            If you've never heard of a Zettelkasten before, I hope you now
            understand its power and are ampted to try it (check out
            <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian.md</a>)! Feel free to
            traverse my second brain up above by searching a tag :).
