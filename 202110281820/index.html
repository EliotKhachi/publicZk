<p>“Alternating current (AC) is an electric current which periodically reverses direction and changes its magnitude continuously with time in contrast to direct current (DC) which flows only in one direction”.</p>
<p>Typically, AC is composed of the sine wave form when plotted on a 2D plane where the x-axis equals time and y-axis equals current or voltage.</p>
