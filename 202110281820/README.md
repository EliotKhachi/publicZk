# Alternating Current (AC)  

"Alternating current (AC) is an electric current which periodically reverses direction and changes its magnitude continuously with time in contrast to direct current (DC) which flows only in one direction". 

Typically, AC is composed of the sine wave form when plotted on a 2D plane where the x-axis equals time and y-axis equals current or voltage.
