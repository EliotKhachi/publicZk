# Application Layers

Every software application is built with layers in order to manage and organize large amounts of code. Large projects can have millions of lines of code with over a thousand source files. Software developers therefore need a way to structure and think about these files by *chunking* them. Chunking is a natural way of thinking for humans

## Order of Chunking - Simple to Complex

1. Statements  
2. Methods  
3. Classes  
4. Packages  
5. Logical Layers  
6. Physical Layers
