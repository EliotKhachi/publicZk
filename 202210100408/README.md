# The Inversion of Control Principle

In software engineering, **inversion of control (IoC)** is a subprinciple stemming from the principle that programs should be modular and extensible.  

The IoC principle concerns itself with the *flow of control* of an application (how the program is being controlled/executed). It serves the following design purposes:
* To *decouple* the execution of a task from implementation.  
* To focus a module on the task it is design for.  
* To free modules from assumptions about how other systems do what they do and instead rely on contracts.  
* to prevent side effects when replacing a module.
