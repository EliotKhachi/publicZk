<p>In software engineering, <strong>inversion of control (IoC)</strong> is a subprinciple stemming from the principle that programs should be modular and extensible.</p>
<p>The IoC principle concerns itself with the <em>flow of control</em> of an application (how the program is being controlled/executed). It serves the following design purposes: * To <em>decouple</em> the execution of a task from implementation.<br />
* To focus a module on the task it is design for.<br />
* To free modules from assumptions about how other systems do what they do and instead rely on contracts.<br />
* to prevent side effects when replacing a module.</p>
