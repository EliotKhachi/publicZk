        <p><em>Bus arbitration</em> is a feature of I2C communcation that safeguards the I2C bus lines from having collisions in the case of multiple masters initiating a transaction at the same time.</p>
        <p>The master that writes a 0 first while the other is writing a 1 will win the arbitration and continue its message while the other master will stop and wait. This is because the master that puts a 1 is actually releasing the SDA line. See <a href="../202112050545/zettel.html">I2C Open-Drain </a> for more information.</p>
