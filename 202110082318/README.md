# Jim Kwik on Focus

"I define concentration as my ability to keep my awareness on one thing for an extended period of time. Every time my concentration drifts, I use my wil power to bring my awareness back" (Dandapani).

Like anything, you can train to get better at concentrating by practicing it. The wonderful thing is that you can practice your concentration on virtually anything at any time. Dandapani defines concentration as "my ability to keep my awareness on one thing for an extended period of time. Every time my concentration drifts, I use my wil power to bring my awareness back" (Kwik). So, whenever possible, try to do one thing at a time and declutter your environment to minimize distraction.

Often times, barriers to achieving focus and and your state of flow {[202110072147](../202110072147) - Jim Kwik on Flow State} are due to a busy mind. Here are 3 tips to clear your mind.

1. **Breathe** (Weil's Method)
	* Exhale compeletely through your mouth
	* Close your mouth and inhale quietly through your nose to a mental count of 4
	* Hold your breath for a count of 7
	* Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound to a count of 8
	* Repeat 3 more times
2. **Do Something That Has Been Causing You Stress**
This goes back to procrastination {[202110080329](../202110080329) - Jim Kwik on the Power of Small Simple Steps (S^3)}. Things weigh on your mind until you finally address them or complete them.
3. **Schedule Time for Distractions**
In addition to scheduling time for deep, concentrated work, schedule time to address the busy tasks on your mind that you may be tempted to do at the first sign of boredom. {[202110031823](../202110031823) - Rule \#2: Embrace Boredom}
