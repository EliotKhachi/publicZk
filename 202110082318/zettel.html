        <p>Like anything, you can train to get better at concentrating by practicing it. The wonderful thing is that you can practice your concentration on virtually anything at any time. Dandapani defines concentration as "my ability to keep my awareness on one thing for an extended period of time. Every time my concentration drifts, I use my wil power to bring my awareness back" (Kwik). So, whenever possible, try to do one thing at a time and declutter your environment to minimize distraction.</p>
