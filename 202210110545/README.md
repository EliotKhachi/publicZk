# Dependency Injection 

In software engineering, **Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern in which an object or function receives other objects or functions that it depends on. It is a form of inversion of control [202210100408](../202210100408).   

## The Answer is DI!
1. How can a class be independent from the creation of the objects it depends on?  
2. How can an application, and the objects it uses support different configurations?  
3. How can the behavior of a piece of code be changed without editing it directly?  

Fundamentally, DI consists of passing parameters to a method.
