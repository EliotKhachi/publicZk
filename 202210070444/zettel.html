        <p>A <strong>computer file</strong> is a computer <em>resource</em> for recording data in a computer <em>storage device</em>, primarily identified by its <em>file name</em>.</p>
        <p>Different files are designed for different purposes: an iamge, a written message, a video, a computer program, an email, a social media post, etc.</p>
        <p><em>Databases</em> store their data in files.</p>
        <p>Most <em>operating systems</em> organize their files into one-dimensional arrays of bytes. Its contents are interpreted meaningfully by knowing the rules for how the bytes were organized. This specific set of rules, or <em>format</em>, is indicated by its filename extension. Alternatively (or additionally), file types can allocate a few bytes for <em>metadata</em>, which allows a file to carry some basic information about itself.</p>
