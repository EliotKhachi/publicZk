# What is A File 

A **computer file** is a computer *resource* for recording data in a computer *storage device*, primarily identified by its *file name*.  

Different files are designed for different purposes: an iamge, a written message, a video, a computer program, an email, a social media post, etc.  

*Databases*  store their data in files.  

Most *operating systems* organize their files into one-dimensional arrays of bytes. Its contents are interpreted meaningfully by knowing the rules for how the bytes were organized. This specific set of rules, or *format*, is indicated by its filename extension. Alternatively (or additionally), file types can allocate a few bytes for *metadata*, which allows a file to carry some basic information about itself.
