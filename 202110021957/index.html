<p>The Model-Based Enterprise (MBE) Self-Assessment tool is outlined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST. The NIST assessment tool divides MBE readiness into 6 levels. {}</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Product Definition</strong> - Geometry, <strong>Product Manufacturing Information (PMI)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Engineering Bill of Materials (EBOM)</strong> - Product structure as designed, contains list of items, assemblies, sub-assemblies. Organized by systems or functionality so integrated product teams can cooperate within a system.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong> - Anything that will be used to predict the performance of the design.</li>
<li><strong>Checking and Model Quality</strong> - Ensures a high quality <strong>Technical Data Package (TDP)</strong> {<a href="../202110032329">202110032329</a> - The Purpose &amp; Benefits of a Technical Data Pack (TDP)}</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><em>Level 1</em>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Product Definition - Drawing is derived fom a model, but is completely disconnected.</p></li>
<li><p>EBOM - Manually defined. Still not linked.</p></li>
<li><p>Analysis - New CAD models are manually generated to support analysis activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Checking and Model Quality - Constructed 3D model, but still using 2D drawings to validate design.</p></li>
<li><p>Logistics/Technical Manuals - 2D drawings, some manual “art”, and some cut-and-paste.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Level 3</em> 1. Product Definition - Models contains some PMI and the drawing is supplemental. 2. EBOM - EBOM managed within PLM or ERP tool. Available for distribution for MBOM (Manufactureing bill of materials. 3. Analysis -Increase the reuse of the model. 4. Checking and Model Quality - 3D model geometry and part annotations are validated</p>
<h2 id="logisticstechnical-manuals--3d-images-from-the-model-replace-some-manual-art.">5. Logistics/Technical Manuals- 3D images from the model replace some manual art.</h2></li>
<li><p><em>Level 4</em> 1. Product Definition -Model contains complete product definition. PMI and drawings are unnecessary. Geometry views are organized by a model based design schema, which provides a layout for storing and reading product definition information. 2. EBOM - PLM based EBOM can be copied and modified to satisfy MBOM needs 3. Analysis - Increase the reuse of the model.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Checking and Model Quality -</li>
<li><h2 id="logisticstechnical-manuals---3d-representations-replaces-2d-depictions">Logistics/Technical Manuals - 3D representations replaces 2D depictions</h2></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><em>Level 5</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Product Definition - Model begins to be utilized in non-traditional activities and penetrates other parts of our enterprise.
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>EBOM - EBOM is completely managed in a PLM system using CAD tools and automation software.</li>
<li>Analysis - Model is reused as the analytical model without any modifications</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Checking and Model Quality -</li>
<li><h2 id="logisticstechnical-manuals---most-likely-generated-by-data-and-image-mining-some-automation-is-used.">Logistics/Technical Manuals - Most likely generated by data and image mining, some automation is used.</h2></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><em>Level 6</em> 1. Product Definition - Model drives all associated activities whether in our organization or other parts of our extended enterprise. Entire supply chain uses the model. 2. EBOM - Automation software is used to develop other BOMs automatically and shared. 3. Analysis - Analysis is automatically performed as design progresses.</p>
<pre><code>  4. Checking and Model Quality -</code></pre>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Logistics/Technical Manuals - Completely automated technical manual creation.</li>
