# The Vee Model


The Vee Model is a model to plan out the system lifecycle as it progress from the customer's need to the concept, development, production, use, maintenance, and disposal.

* **Lifecycle Processes** *(Beginning of "V")*  
	
	1. Regional Architecture(s)  
	
	2. Feasibility Study/ Concept Exploration

* **Decomposition and Definition** *(Left-side of "V")*  
	
	3. ConOps  
	
	4. System Requirements  
	
	5. High-Level Design  
	
	6. Detailed Design  
	
* **Implementation and Development Processes** *(Bottom of "V")*  
	
	7. Softare/Hardware Development Field Installation

* **Integration and Recomposition** *(Right-side of "V")*  
	
	8. Unit/Device Testing  
		
	9. Subsystem Verification  
	
	10. System Verification & Deployment  
	
	11. System Validation

* **Lifecycle Processes Cont.** *(End of "V")*  
	
	12. Operations and Maintenance  
	
	13. Changes and Upgrades  
	
	14. Retirement/Replacement

**NOTE:** Between the left-side *(Decomposition and Definition)* and right-side *(Integration and Recomposition)* of the "V", there is constant iteration between *a* and *b* **through** *c*.
