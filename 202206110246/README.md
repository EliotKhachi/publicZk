# What is HTTP?

*HTTP* stands for *HyperText Transfer Protocol* and is the underlying network protocol that enables transfer of hypermedia documents on the web, typically bewteen a browser and a server.  

The *http* within a *URL* is called a "scheme". *http* indicates that a resource is being transported over an unencrypted connection, as opposed to the *https* scheme, which indicates that resource is being transported using the HTTP protocol, but over a secure *TLS* channel.
