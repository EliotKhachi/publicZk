        <h1 id="what-is-http">What is HTTP?</h1>
        <p><em>HTTP</em> stands for <em>HyperText Transfer Protocol</em> and is the underlying network protocol that enables transfer of hypermedia documents on the web, typically between a browser (client) and a server. Clients make the HTTP requests to the server, and the server <em>must</em> answer with a response.</p>
        <p><a href="../202212050324/zettel.html">Types of HTTP Requests</a></p>
        <p>A <em>protocol</em> is a set of rules for communication between two computers. HTTP is a textual, stateless protocol.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><em>Textual</em> - All commands are plain-text and human-readable</li>
        <li><em>Stateless</em> - Neither the server nor the client remembers previous communications</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="server-side">Server Side</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>The HTTP server first checks if the requested file's URL matches an existing file.</li>
        <li>If so, the web server sends the file content back to the browser. If not, an application server builds the necessary file.</li>
        <li>If neither process is possible, the web server returns an error message to the browser, most commonly 404 Not Found. The 404 error is so common that some web designers devote considerable time and effort to designing 404 error pages.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="http-vs-https">HTTP vs HTTPS</h2>
        <p>The <em>http</em> within a <em>URL</em> is called a "scheme". <em>http</em> indicates that a resource is being transported over an unencrypted connection, as opposed to the <em>https</em> scheme, which indicates that resource is being transported using the HTTP protocol, but over a secure <em>TLS</em> channel.</p>
