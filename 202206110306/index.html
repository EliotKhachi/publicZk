<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>To fetch a webpage, your browser sends a request to the web server, which searches for the requested file in its own storage space. Upon finding the file, the server reads it, processes it as-needed, and sends it to the browser. Let’s look at those steps in more detail.</p>
<h2 id="hosting-files">Hosting Files</h2>
<p>Technically, you could host all those files on your own computer, but it’s far more convenient to store files all on a dedicated web server because they:<br />
* Are always up and running<br />
* Have a dedicated IP address<br />
* Are maintained by a third party</p>
