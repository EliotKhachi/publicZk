        <p>LED stands for Light-Emitting Diode. It's basically a tiny little light-bulb. <a href="../202305080356/index.html">Diodes</a></p>
        <h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
        <p>LEDs have two leads: the longer lead is the anode (+) and the shorter lead is the cathode (-). If both leads are the same length, look for the flat side of the bulb: that side is the cathode.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>If the LED is in the circuit its leads in reverse (the anode is connected to the negative terminal of the battery), the LED won't work and can be damaged.</li>
        <li>LEDs can only handle very little current. A resistor is required in the circuit to use an LED properly and safely. <a href="../202305072106/index.html">How Much Resistance?</a></li>
