<h1 id="leds">LEDs</h1>
<p>LED stands for Light-Emitting Diode. It’s basically a tiny little light-bulb. <a href="../202305080356">Diodes</a></p>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>LEDs have two leads: the longer lead is the anode (+) and the shorter lead is the cathode (-). If both leads are the same length, look for the flat side of the bulb: that side is the cathode.</p>
<h2 id="application">Application</h2>
<ul>
<li>If the LED is in the circuit its leads in reverse (the anode is connected to the negative terminal of the battery), the LED won’t work and can be damaged.<br />
</li>
<li>LEDs can only handle very little current. A resistor is required in the circuit to use an LED properly and safely. <a href="../202305072106">How Much Resistance?</a></li>
