# LEDs

LED stands for Light-Emitting Diode. It's basically a tiny little light-bulb.  

## Structure
LEDs have two leads: the longer lead is the anode (+) and the shorter lead is the cathode (-). If both leads are the same length, look for the flat side of the bulb: that side is the cathode.  

## Application
* If the LED is in the circuit its leads in reverse (the anode is connected to the negative terminal of the battery), the LED won't work and can be damaged.  
* LEDs can only handle very little current. A resistor is required in the circuit to use an LED properly and safely.
