# What is a Command?

A command is a sequence of computer instructions that get executed when it's invoked in the terminal, i.e. by typing its name and pressing enter.  

For example, `ls` prints all the subdirectories in your current directory.  

In the previous example, no *input* was given. By default, your current directory is taken to be the input. 
`ls Documents` prints the subdirectories in the directory `Documents`.  

Usually commands take in input(s), does something with it, and produces an output.  
`wc -l myfile` takes in `myfile` as an input, counts the number of lines in it, and outputs the number of lines.  

The `-l` is called an *option*. Depending on what options are used, commands do different things, i.e. different computer instructions are executed.
