# LRE Components and Purpose (High-Level) 

|Component|Purpose|  
|-|-|  
|Injector|To deliver the fuel and oxidizer propellants into a combustion chamber in an atomized, combustible form with a sufficient pressure drop.|  
|Ignitor|To initiate the combustion process by igniting the atomized propellants inside a combustion chamber. This can be done with *hypergolic propellants*, *pyrotechnic devices*, *electrical sparks*, *electrically heated filaments*, *electrically powered laser (demonstrated but uncommon)*.|  
|Combustion Chamber|To contain the combustion reaction. It is a portion of the thrust-chamber-nozzle and is generally the shape of a cylinder.|
|Nozzle|To accelerate the resulting hot gases [isentropically](../202201152231). It is the larger and latter (in terms of flow direction) portion of the thrust-chamber nozzle| 
|Feed System|*Purpose*|Depending on the combustion cycle of the engine, the feed systems delivers propellants through pipes, directed by valves,  from the propellant tanks to any and all injectors, cooling channels, and turbopumps. See [Liquid Rocket Engine Combustion Cycles]().
|Turbopump|*Purpose*|
