## Don't Take Breaks From Distraction. Instead Take Breaks From FOCUS
* Set aside blocks of time to use the internet & refrain from it. Abide by the schedule to train your mental muscles.
* Avoid switching from low-stimuli and high-value to high-stimuli and low-value work at the slightest hint of boredom.

## Work Like Teddy Roosevelt
Roosevelt was a man of many interests, yet he managed to do well in Harvard & publish a book after his freshman year ended. He used his time extremely efficiently by working with great intensity. To train to work intensely, set a hard deadline for yourself by drastically reducing the time you'd normally set aside for a task. You should consistently be able to beat the buzzer.
