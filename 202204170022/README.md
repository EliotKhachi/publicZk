# Manufacturing Process 

## What
A manufacturing process refers to a series of steps for making something, like a pencil. There are manufacturing processes for making chemicals, solid materials, and assemblies containing multiple different materials.  

## Why
Ultimately, the goal of a manufacturing process is to get the desired geometry and material properties for a material or combination of materials, and put them in the desired configuration.
