# Decomposing a System 

Complex systems can seemingly be broken down infinitely, so when do we stop?

**Example:**
Airplane
* Wings
	* Fuel Storage
		* Material Compatibility
			* Chemical make-up of fuel and tank material
		* Tank Structural Integrity
	* Structural Integrity
	* Aerodynamic performance
* Fuselage
	* Passengers
	* Structural Integrity
* Engines
	* Feed System
	* Turbine
	* Ignitor
	* Structural Integrity
* Passenger Safety
	* On-boarding
	* Off-boarding
	* In-flight
		* Safety Manuals
		* Oxygen Masks
		
* Maintenance
	* Storage
	* Engine Maintenance
	* Avionics Control Checks

* Operations
	* Design Missions
		* Take-off
		* Cruise
		* Landing
		* Emergency Fuel Dump

---  
The above example system was broken down into levels of detail arbitrarily for the sake of demonstration.
In practice, when a subsystem or element can be considered as a "black-box", to sufficiently define the system, no further decomposition is necessary. For example, when a subsystem or element is purchased, the vendor promises to the buyer certain attributes of their product that need not be verified. However, the integration of that product with the rest of the subsystem must verified.
