# Class B Missions

Class B missions are critical operational, exploration, or technical demonstrators where only minor compromises are made to achieve a **low risk profile**.  

## Characteristics 
* High cost  
* High / medium complexity  
* Long mission life  
* Cost plus / firm fixed price contracting  
* Moderate launch constraints  

## Mission Assurance Processes
**Requirements Analysis and Validation**  
* Requirement traceability at every level
**Design Assurance**  
* Same as Class A
**Integration, Test & Evaluation**  
* Same interface modeling and traceability requirements as Class A  
* May allow simulation and modeling in place of physical test for non-critical requirements  
**Software Assurance**  
* Same as Class A

## Examples  
* Mars Exploration Rover (MER)  
* Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)  
* ISS payloads
