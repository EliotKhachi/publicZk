# Alternating vs Direct Current 

Alternating current (AC) is a form of electricity wherein the direction of flow of the current in the wire *alternates* many times per second. [Alternating Current (AC) ](../202110281820). Direct current (DC), on the other hand, does not change its flow direction. [Direct Current (DC)](../202110281823)  

## Relationship
AC and DC currents can be converted into one another using an analog-to-digital converter.
