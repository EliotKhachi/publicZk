# Alternating vs Direct Current

## Different Forms of Electricity
Alternating current (AC) is a form of electricity wherein the direction of flow of the current in the wire *alternates* many times per second. [Alternating Current (AC) ](../202110281820)

The direction of flow for direct current (DC), on the other hand, does not change.

## Different Applications
Typically, alternating current is used when dealing with large amounts of energy. Think of a refrigerator in your home and industrial machines in the factory. The wall outlet in your home outputs AC current.

Direct current is used in devices with batteries. Your laptop, computer, phone, wireless speakers, etc..

## Relationship
AC and DC currents can be converted into one another using an analog-to-digital converter.
