# String Commands Together

*Pipes* are used to redirect the [Standard Output](../202305212216/README.md) of one command to the [Standard Input](../202305212202/README.md) of another.  

## Example
```
who | sort  # sends the output of who into the sort program, printing an alphabetically sorted listed of logged-in users.  
```
