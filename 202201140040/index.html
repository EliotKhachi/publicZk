<ul>
<li>Start and shutdown characteristics of a liquid rocket engine are best depicted with a Thrust vs Time curve beginning from the time of the cut-off signal to the cessation of thrust.</li>

<li>At the time of the cut-off signal, the thrust-level is still at 100%<br />
</li>
<li>After a short period of time (0 - 0.5 s) the main valves begin to close</li>
<li>Following shortly afterward is a decrease in power from the turbine. See <a href="../202201100451">Turbopump</a> for more information.</li>
<li>After another short period of time ~0.5 s, the valves are fully closed. During this time is the sharpest decline in thrust.</li>
<li>Finally after another short period (~0.5s) we have full cessation of thrust.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="start-and-shutdown-functional-requirements">Start and Shutdown Functional Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Compliance with specified thrust-vs.-time characteristics.<br />
</li>
<li>Maximum rate of increase at any time during buildup.<br />
</li>
<li>Freedom from surges and thrust overshoots.<br />
</li>
<li>Smoothness (freedom from damaging oscillations).<br />
</li>
<li>Repeatability from run to run and from engine to engine.</li>
