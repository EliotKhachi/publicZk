        <ul>
        <li>Start and shutdown characteristics of a liquid rocket engine are best depicted with a Thrust vs Time curve beginning from the time of the cut-off signal to the cessation of thrust.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><img src="$USERDIR/Zettelkasten/Pictures/Fig5p3-1" alt="Figure 2.3: Typical Thrust-Decay Diagram" /></p>
        <ol>
        <li>At the time of the cut-off signal, the thrust-level is still at 100%</li>
        <li>After a short period of time (0 - 0.5 s) the main valves begin to close</li>
        <li>Following shortly afterward is a decrease in power from the turbine. See <a href="../202201100451/zettel.html">Turbopump</a> for more information.</li>
        <li>After another short period of time ~0.5 s, the valves are fully closed. During this time is the sharpest decline in thrust.</li>
        <li>Finally after another short period (~0.5s) we have full cessation of thrust.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="start-and-shutdown-functional-requirements">Start and Shutdown Functional Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Compliance with specified thrust-vs.-time characteristics.</li>
        <li>Maximum rate of increase at any time during buildup.</li>
        <li>Freedom from surges and thrust overshoots.</li>
        <li>Smoothness (freedom from damaging oscillations).</li>
        <li>Repeatability from run to run and from engine to engine.</li>
