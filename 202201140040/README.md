# Start and Shutdown Characteristics 

* Start and shutdown characteristics of a liquid rocket engine are best depicted with a Thrust vs Time curve beginning from the time of the cut-off signal to the cessation of thrust.  

![Figure 2.3: Typical Thrust-Decay Diagram]($USERDIR/Zettelkasten/Pictures/Fig5p3-1)  

1. At the time of the cut-off signal, the thrust-level is still at 100%  
2. After a short period of time (0 - 0.5 s) the main valves begin to close 
3. Following shortly afterward is a decrease in power from the turbine. See [Turbopump](./202201100451) for more information.
4. After another short period of time ~0.5 s, the valves are fully closed. During this time is the sharpest decline in thrust.
5. Finally after another short period (~0.5s) we have full cessation of thrust.

## Start and Shutdown Functional Requirements
* Compliance with specified thrust-vs.-time characteristics.  
* Maximum rate of increase at any time during buildup.  
* Freedom from surges and thrust overshoots.  
* Smoothness (freedom from damaging oscillations).  
* Repeatability from run to run and from engine to engine.
