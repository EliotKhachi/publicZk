<h1 id="availability-zone">Availability Zone</h1>
<p>Multiple, isolation locations known as <em>Availablity Zones</em> exist in each <a href="../202309120400">AWS Region</a>. Each Availability Zone contains multiple data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, and housed in separate facilities.</p>
<p>If you distribute your instances across multiple Availability Zones and one instance fails, you can design your application so that an instance in another Availability Zone can handle requests.</p>
<p>The code for Availability Zone is its Region code followed by a letter identifier. For example, us-east-1a.</p>
