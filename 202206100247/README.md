# Host a Website on AWS (EC2 Instance)

To deploy a website to the internet, you need a web hosting service to, at a bare minimum, operate and maintain the servers that keep it up and running. AWS does this and more, such as backing up your data and security.  

An *instance* is a virtual server in the AWS Cloud. The Amazon EC2 is the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud* instance. With Amazon EC2 you can configure the OS and applications that run on your instance. See [202206101828](../202206101828) - What is an Instance?
