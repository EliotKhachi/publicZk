# Welding Processes
There are 4 most-common welding processes

1. MIG - Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW)  
MIG welding is simple and popular. It involves a welding *gun* that has two concentric nozzles. The inner nozzle, *feeds* the filler metal in the form of a wire to the base metal. The outer nozzle *expels* shielding gas, such as Argon, around the feed wire. The tip of the wire also acts as electrode to create the arc with the base metal, thereby generating heat to melt the base metal and adding the filler metal.
