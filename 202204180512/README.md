# Characteristic Length

The characteristic length *L* is the length in a fluid flow that most accurately depicts the length-scale of the flow. 

## Examples
1. Flow past a circle - *L* = diameter  
2. Flow past an airfoil - *L* = chord line [\[Airfoil \]](../202110160051)  
3. Flow inside a long pipe (*Fully-developed flow*) - *L* = inner-diameter  
4. Flow inside a short pipe - *L* = channel diameter *or* distance from the entry to the end of the pipe   
5. Flow over a semi-infinite horizontal plate - *L* = length measured from the leading edge  

**NOTE** that characteristic lengths are not always trivial to figure out in compicated flows and sometimes we assume a length-scale and conduct tests to prove or disprove it.
