# Cause for an ECO  

There are various reasons why an ECO (engineering change order) is issued:

* Correction of a design error that became evident during testing and modeling, or when customers reveal it
* Changes in the customers' requirements necessitating redesigns of one or more parts of the products
* A change in manfacturing method or material caused by changes in vendors, a lack of material availability, or the need to compensate for design errors.
