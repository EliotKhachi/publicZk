<h1 id="cause-for-an-eco">Cause for an ECO</h1>
<p>There are various reasons why an ECO (engineering change order) is issued:</p>
<ul>
<li>Correction of a design error that became evident during testing and modeling, or when customers reveal it</li>
<li>Changes in the customers’ requirements necessitating redesigns of one or more parts of the products</li>
<li>A change in manfacturing method or material caused by changes in vendors, a lack of material availability, or the need to compensate for design errors.</li>
</ul>
