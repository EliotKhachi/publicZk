<h1 id="airfoil">Airfoil</h1>
<p>An airfoil is the cross-section of an aircraft wing. The following parameters are used to characterize the geometry of airfoils:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Leading edge</strong> - the forward-most edge of the wing, depicted as the forward-most point of the airfoil in a 2D representation.</li>
<li><strong>Trailing edge</strong> - the backward-most edge of the wing, depicted as the forward-most point of the airfoil in a 2D representation.</li>
<li><strong>Chord linei</strong> - the line that connects the leading edge and trailing edge.</li>
<li><strong>Mean camber line</strong> - the line mid-way between the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil. Described how curved an airfoil is.
<ul>
<li>Symmetrical airofils have no camber</li>
<li>Positive camber airfoils produce lift at 0 angle of attack</li>
<li>Negative camber airfoils produce downforce at 0 angle of attack [[Angle of Attack]](../202110160058)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
