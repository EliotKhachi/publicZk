# Airfoil 

An airfoil is the cross-section of an aircraft wing. The following parameters are used to characterize the geometry of airfoils:

1. **Leading edge** - the forward-most edge of the wing, depicted as the forward-most point of the airfoil in a 2D representation.
2. **Trailing edge** - the backward-most edge of the wing, depicted as the forward-most point of the airfoil in a 2D representation.
3. **Chord linei** - the line that connects the leading edge and trailing edge. 
4. **Mean camber line** - the line mid-way between the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil. Described how curved an airfoil is.
	* Symmetrical airofils have no camber
	* Positive camber airfoils produce lift at 0 angle of attack
	* Negative camber airfoils produce downforce at 0 angle of attack \[[Angle of Attack]\](../202110160058)
