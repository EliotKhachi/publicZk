# React Core Concepts

**(React) Component** - A JavaScript class that extends `React.Component`. Its constructor should begin with a `super(props)` call.

**Prop** - Short for *property*. A class attribute added by extending `React.Component` (`this.props`). Used to access the React component class attributes (`this.props.react-component-attribute-name`).

**Function Component** - A function with `props` as inputs and returns what should be rendered. Used when you just need to render something and you don't need a component that maintains its own state.
