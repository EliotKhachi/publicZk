# MBSE Background

* What is Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and what value does it provide? [[What is Model-Based Systems Engineering? ](../202110052023)]  
* A "model" is a digital representation of a system [[What is a System](../202110032156)]. In the backend, the model is stored in a NoSQL database.  
* The model is not shown all at once. Rather, there are various "views" of the model. Each view is textually encoded as an XML/JSON/SysML file, with a [block-diagram-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_diagram) graphical representation. The graphical and textual representations of SysML are much more expressive than block diagrams [[What is SysML?](../202110032315)].  

## Example of a SysML File and Model View
