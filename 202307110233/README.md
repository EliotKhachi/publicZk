# Deactivating Strategies

*Deactivating strategies* are thoughts and behaviors that are used to squelch intimacy.  

## Examples
* Saying (or thinking) "I'm not ready to commit"-- but staying together nonetheless, sometimes for years.  
* Focusing on small imperfections in your partner.  
* Pining after an ex-girlfriend/boyfriend (the "phantom ex").  
* Flirting with others while in a relationship.  
* Not saying "I love you"-- while implying that you do have feelings towards the other person.  
* Pulling away when things are going well.  
* "Checking out mentally" when your partner is talking to you.  
* Keeping secrets and leaving things foggy-- to maintain your feeling of independence.  
* Avoiding physical closeness.
