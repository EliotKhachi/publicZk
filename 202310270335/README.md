# The 3 Pillars of Model-Based Systems Engineering

The 3 pillars of [Model-Based Systems Engineering](../202110052023) are:  

1. Modeling Language - Rules used to define the model [[What is SysML? ](../202110032315)]
2. Modeling Methods - Roadmap of design tasks for a team to build the model consistently towards a common end point. [Implementing a Model-Based Enterprise ](../202110032326)
3. Modeling Tools - Software designed to implement and enforce the rules of the modeling language, and reduce friction in performing the modeling methods.  

All 3 pillars are needed to make a good model of a system. Whether or not that system is *well-designed* is outside the scope of MBSE.
