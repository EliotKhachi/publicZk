# What is an SOW?

An SOW will usually contain four elements:

1. A summary that explains the purpose of the project  
2. A project governance section that explains who has approval to do what  
3. A project scope that identifies key deliverables, whoâ€™s responsible for each of these deliverables  and how the project will be priced  
4. A project schedule, sometimes called a work breakdown structure (WBS), that breaks down the deliverables into tasks and milestones
