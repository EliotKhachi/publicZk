        <li><p>"A system is <em>everything</em> that costs the Program Manager money and <em>everything</em> it takes to enable the mission to be performed." (Dobbs)</p></li>
        <li><p>A system is an "integrated ste of elements, subsystems or assemblies that accomplish a defined objective" (INCOSE).</p></li>
        <li><p>Anything man-made was created with a purpose, and can therefore be conceptualized as a system.</p></li>
        <li><p>Systems are also defined in terms of its boundaries. The environment in which the system operates in is a major consideration.</p></li>
