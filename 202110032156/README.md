# What is a System

* "A system is *everything* that costs the Program Manager money and *everything* it takes to enable the mission to be performed." - Prof. Steven Dobbs
* A system is an "integrated ste of elements, subsystems or assemblies that accomplish a defined objective" (INCOSE).

* Anything man-made was created with a purpose, and can therefore be conceptualized as a system.

* Systems engineers start at high levels of abstraction and decompose systems into more and more layers of detail (subsystems and components) to compartmentalize the problem. There are various stages that go into developing a system and ways to determine whether it was built correctly. 

* Systems are also defined in terms of its boundaries. The environment in which the system operates in is a major consideration.
