# What is a System 

* "A system is *everything* that costs the Program Manager money and *everything* it takes to enable the mission to be performed." (Dobbs)  
* A system is an "integrated ste of elements, subsystems or assemblies that accomplish a defined objective" (INCOSE).  
* Anything man-made was created with a purpose, and can therefore be conceptualized as a system.  

* Systems are also defined in terms of its boundaries. The environment in which the system operates in is a major consideration.
