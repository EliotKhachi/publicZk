# What is a System 

* "A part of a system is *anything* that costs the Program Manager money and the whole system is *everything* it takes to enable the mission to be performed." (Steven Dobbs)  
* A system is an "integrated set of elements, subsystems or assemblies that accomplish a defined objective" (INCOSE).  
* Anything man-made was created with a purpose, and can therefore be conceptualized as a system.  
* "The functionality of a system is typically expressed in terms of the interactions of the system with its operating environment, especially the users."
