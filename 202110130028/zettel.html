        <p>Static pressure is the pressure one would experience by a fluid if one were to move along with the fluid, thus being "static" relative to the moving fluid.</p>
        <p>If the fluid is already stationary, such as a gas in a container, the static pressure is equal to the total pressure of the fluid.</p>
