# RESTful vs Traditional MVC Controller

The difference between a traditional MVC controller and the RESTful web service controller is the way the HTTP response body is created.

**Traditional MVC Controller -** Performs server-side rendering of the data to HTML.

**RESTful Web Service Conroller -** Populates and returns an object, and the object data is written directly to the HTTP response as JSON.
