        <p><strong>SysML</strong> - Systems Modeling Language</p>
        <p>SysML is a subset of <strong>UML</strong> - Unified Modeling Language</p>
        <p>UML is a software engineering modeling language enabling visualization &amp; communication with-respect-to program structure and details.</p>
        <p>SysML is a graphical modeling language that supports systems engineering.</p>
        <p>SysML does not resemble a language at first glace, nor is it modeling itself. The modeling work is the systems engineering process, SysML is a tool used by systems engineers to represent various aspects of systems engineering through 9 diagrams.</p>
