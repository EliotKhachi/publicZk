# What is SysML? 

* SysML stands for Systems Modeling Language.  
* It's a graphical modeling language that supports systems engineering.  
* It defines the kinds of elements you're allowed to put in your model and the allowable relationships between them.  
* It defines the rules. 
* It closes the communications gap between systems and software engineers.  
* It is an *enabler* for Model-Based Systems Engineering

SysML does not resemble a language at first glace, nor is it modeling itself. The modeling work is the systems engineering process itself. SysML is a tool used by systems engineers to represent various aspects of systems engineering through its 4 Pillars or 9 Diagrams.
