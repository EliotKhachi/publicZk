# Steps to Implementing a Model-Based Enterprise

* Begin by defining your purpose for implementing a Model-Based approach
* Use a CAD tool and implement it into a 3D Technical Data Package ().
* Don't try to "boil the ocean". Simplify and implement one feature at a time.
* Share CAD files across departments, emphasize communication through the model.

**Remember** MBSE is more of an organizational change initiative rather than a software because it's all about how you represent knowledge within the organization and facilitate information flow. All relevant persons must agree to use it.
