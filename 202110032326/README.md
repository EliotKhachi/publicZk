# Implementing a Model-Based Enterprise 

Implementing [Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)](../202110052023) is just as much of an organizational change initiative as it is a software adoption initiative because it's all about how you represent knowledge within the organization and facilitate information flow. All relevant persons must agree to use it.  

Begin by defining your purpose for implementing a Model-Based approach. In other words, don't try to "boil the ocean". Simplify and implement one feature at a time.
