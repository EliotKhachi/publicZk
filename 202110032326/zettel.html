        <ul>
        <li>Begin by defining your purpose for implementing a Model-Based approach</li>
        <li>Use a CAD tool and implement it into a 3D Technical Data Package ().</li>
        <li>Don't try to "boil the ocean". Simplify and implement one feature at a time.</li>
        <li>Share CAD files across departments, emphasize communication through the model.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Remember</strong> MBSE is more of an organizational change initiative rather than a software because it's all about how you represent knowledge within the organization and facilitate information flow. All relevant persons must agree to use it.</p>
