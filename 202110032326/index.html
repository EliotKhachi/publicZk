<ul>
<li>Begin by defining your purpose for implementing a Model-Based approach</li>
<li>Use a CAD tool and implement it into a 3D Technical Data Package ().</li>

<li>Share CAD files across departments, emphasize communication through the model.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remember</strong> MBSE is more of an organizational change initiative rather than a software because it’s all about how you represent knowledge within the organization and facilitate information flow. All relevant persons must agree to use it. ## Tags #systemsEngineering #MBSE</p>
