# Layers vs Tiers

Why do we layer software? Primarily to gain the benefits of logical organization and grouping of like functionality [[Software Architecture Layers](https://github.com/EliotKhachi//publicZk/tree/main/202209172045)].  

Why do we deploy layers onto multiple tiers? Primarily to obtain a balance between performance, scalability, fault tolerance, latency, and security [[Application Tiers](https://github.com/EliotKhachi//publicZk/tree/main/202309162313)].
