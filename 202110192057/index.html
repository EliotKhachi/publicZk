<p>There are 2 main modes when outputting to a pin: <strong>Open Drain</strong> - MCU pin acts as an input signal to a transistor. Generally used when there are multiple signals on a single line to communicate with each other. Important to use a pull up or pull down resistor to cancel noise from the pin.</p>
<p><strong>Push-Pull</strong> - Not necessary to use a <em>pull-up</em> or <em>pull-down</em> state. The <em>None</em> state is used for output pins and this mode.</p>
<p>There are 3 states for each mode: 1. <em>Pull-up</em> 2. <em>Pull down</em> 3. <em>None</em></p>
<p>States are configured internally (through code) by <strong>registers</strong>.</p>
