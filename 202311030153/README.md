# Denying the Antecedent Fallacy

*Denying the antecedent* fallacy, sometimes called the *inverse error* or *fallacy of the inverse* is a logical fallacy whereby, given a valid premise and conclusion, the inverse of the conclusion can be drawn from the inverse of the premise.  

For example,  
*Premise*: You are a ski instructor.  
*Conclusion*: You have a job.

*Inverse Premise*: You are not a ski instructor.  
*Inverse Conclusion:* You do not have a job.  

The inverse conclusion is an obvious false one.
