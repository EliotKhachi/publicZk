        <p>The concept of <strong>jumpy learning</strong> is to study things in the order that you are <em>interested</em> in them rather than the order that they were <em>given to you</em>.</p>
        <p>This is because your attention and motivation are limited resources. By letting your attention lead you through the content, you are preserving your will power to stay focused. You are naturally being drawn in by the content.</p>
