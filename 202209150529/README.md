# The Spring Container 

A Spring IoC container is a conceptual construct used to understand how Spring works. This container takes in configuration metadata/information that represents how you, as an app developer, want the Spring container to instantiate, configure, and assemble the objects in your application.  

A Spring IoC container can be instantiated with a few lines of XML dependency injections. The DIs in particular depend on the type of application you are building.
