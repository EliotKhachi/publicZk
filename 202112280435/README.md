# GD&T True Position 

In manufacturing, you can never make two parts exactly the same. This is why each part needs a tolerance to be made to. If the part meets its ascribed tolerance, then the part is good!

The True Position of a feature, say a hole, is the *exact* location of the center axis of that hole. Suppose a *Basic Dimension* is given for the location of a hole, then that dimensions calls out the *true position* of the hole.
