<p>In manufacturing, you can never make two parts exactly the same. This is why each part needs a tolerance to be made to. If the part meets its ascribed tolerance, then the part is good!</p>
<p>The True Position of a feature, say a hole, is the <em>exact</em> location of the center axis of that hole. Suppose a <em>Basic Dimension</em> is given for the location of a hole, then that dimensions calls out the <em>true position</em> of the hole.</p>
