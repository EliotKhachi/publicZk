        <p>In software development, <em>Known good state</em> is a predefined set of data that guarantees our tests will pass if our methods are correct. Without known good state, code that is functionally correct may fail in a test because it's working on bad data.</p>
        <h2 id="example">Example</h2>
        <p><strong>Given:</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Test 1 <em>asserts</em> that there are 5 records in the file.</li>
        <li>Test 2 <em>asserts</em> that a record can be added to the file.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Potential Issue:</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>If Test 2 is ran before Test 1, Test 1 will fail even if it is functionally correct because it is operating under a false assumption of the current state of the database: There are <em>no longer</em> 5 records in the file.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="good-practices">Good Practices</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Pre-populate a file with a known good state and copy the contents of that file into a test file before a test runs.</li>
        </ul>
