<h1 id="known-good-state">Known Good State</h1>
<p>In software development, <em>Known good state</em> is a predefined set of data that guarantees our tests will pass if our methods are correct. Without known good state, code that is functionally correct may fail in a test because it’s working on bad data.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p><strong>Given:</strong> * Test 1 <em>asserts</em> that there are 5 records in the file. * Test 2 <em>asserts</em> that a record can be added to the file.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Issue:</strong> * If Test 2 is ran before Test 1, Test 1 will fail even if it is functionally correct because it is operating under a false assumption of the current state of the database: There are <em>no longer</em> 5 records in the file.</p>
<h2 id="good-practices">Good Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pre-populate a file with a known good state and copy the contents of that file into a test file before a test runs.</li>
</ul>
