# Estimating Project Costs and Schedule

## What
Project estimation is the process of accurately forecasting the time, cost, and resources required for a project.  

## Why
Project estimation is critical because it sets expectations. A project lead must be aware of the goal and what it takes to achieve it. Project estimates also help the lead circle back and modify the goal or set incremental milestones that align with the current resources at hand.
