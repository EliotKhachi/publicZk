<p>The purpose of build tools is to automate the process of compiling your source code into machine-readable and executable code.</p>
<p>When dealing with large projects with hundreds of source files, it becomes difficut and tedious to manually compile each file with the JDK (Java Development Kit).<br />
Additionally, you must compile each file in a particular order since they depend on each other.</p>
<p>Build tools automate and optimize this process.</p>
