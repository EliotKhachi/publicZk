# Why Do We Need Build Tools

The purpose of build tools is to automate the process of compiling your source code into machine-readable and executable code.  

When dealing with large projects with hundreds of source files, it becomes difficut and tedious to manually compile each file with the JDK (Java Development Kit).  
Additionally, you must compile each file in a particular order since they depend on each other.  

Build tools automate and optimize this process.
