        <p>In any given flow field, such as flow through a pipe, each individual fluid particle travels a given path. These paths are called streamlines.</p>
        <p>More formally, streamlines are lines that are tangent to the velocity vectors throughout a given flow field. They are generally represented as lines on a 2-dimensional spatial plane (x-y, x-z, y-z), but can also be represented in a 3-dimensional spatial space (x-y-z).</p>
        <p>For steady flow, the streamlines do not change with time. In unsteady flow, streamlines can only be represented in space at a certain points in time, since they are different at any given time.<br />
