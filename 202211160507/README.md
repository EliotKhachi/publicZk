# Relational Databases 

**Relational databases** are *databases* that use the concept of a 
**relation**, or **table**, to organize/link data together. A table is a 
2-D grid of rows and columns; at each intersection of a row and a column 
exists a cell that holds a value. The column titles are **attributes** 
, the cells are the **fields** (of values) for those attributes, and each row 
is a **record** that represents a cohesive item.
