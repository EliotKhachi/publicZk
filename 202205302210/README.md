# Dynamic Programming 

When solving a complicated algorithm-based problem or leetcode problem, these are the steps you need to follow:

1. Think of the simplest cases and how the problem changes over time
Before tackling the entire problem all at once, think of the simplest scenarios that you could intuitively solve.  

e.g. in the fibonacci problem, you are trying to return the *nth* number in the fibonacci sequence given *n*. The simplest cases are the *1st* and *2nd* numbers, which are both 1 by default.  

Also, draw a visual representation of the problem such as a tree to better grasp it.  

2. Brute force solution  
*Just* try to solve the problem. Don't worry about optimizations. Those come after and are usually easy to implement.  

3. Optimize (if necessary)
