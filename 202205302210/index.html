<h1 id="dynamic-programming">Dynamic Programming</h1>
<p>When solving a complicated algorithm-based problem or leetcode problem, these are the steps you need to follow:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Think of the simplest cases and how the problem changes over time Before tackling the entire problem all at once, think of the simplest scenarios that you could intuitively solve.</li>
</ol>
<p>e.g. in the fibonacci problem, you are trying to return the <em>nth</em> number in the fibonacci sequence given <em>n</em>. The simplest cases are the <em>1st</em> and <em>2nd</em> numbers, which are both 1 by default.</p>
<p>Also, draw a visual representation of the problem such as a tree to better grasp it.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Brute force solution<br />
<em>Just</em> try to solve the problem. Don’t worry about optimizations. Those come after and are usually easy to implement.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimize (if necessary)</p></li>
</ol>
