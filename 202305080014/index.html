<h1 id="multimeter">Multimeter</h1>
<p>A Multimeter is a tool used to evaluate the properties of a circuit in order to investigate and resolve issues. A multimeter utilizes two probes to place between any two points in the circuit.</p>
<p>A multimeter can tell us the following things about the two points:<br />
1. Whether the points are connected (closed circuit) or disconnected (open circuit).<br />
2. The voltage between each point.<br />
3. The current between each point.<br />
4. The resistance between each point.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To measure the voltage drop or resistance connect the multimeter probes in parallel.</p></li>
<li><p>To measure the current, the multimeter must be connected in series at that point.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to use your multimeter properly, make sure to refer to your multimeterâ€™s user manual.</p>
