        <p>A Multimeter is a tool used to evaluate the properties of a circuit in order to investigate and resolve issues. A multimeter utilizes two probes to place between any two points in the circuit.</p>
        <p>A multimeter can tell us the following things about the two points:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Whether the points are connected (closed circuit) or disconnected (open circuit).</li>
        <li>The voltage between each point.</li>
        <li>The current between each point.</li>
        <li>The resistance between each point.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
        <li><p>To measure the voltage drop or resistance connect the multimeter probes in parallel.</p></li>
        <li><p>To measure the current, the multimeter must be connected in series at that point.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In order to use your multimeter properly, make sure to refer to your multimeter's user manual.</p>
