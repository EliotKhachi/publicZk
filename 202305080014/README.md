# Multimeter

A Multimeter is a tool used to evaluate the properties of a circuit in order to investigate and resolve issues. A multimeter utilizes two probes to place between any two points in the circuit.  

A multimeter can tell us the following things about the two points:  
1. Whether the points are connected (closed circuit) or disconnected (open circuit).  
2. The voltage between each point.  
3. The current between each point.  
4. The resistance between each point.  

* To measure the voltage drop between two points or resistance between two points, the multimeter probes can be connected in parallel.  

* To measure the current at a specific point in the circuit, the multimeter must be connected in series at that point.  

In order to use your multimeter properly, make sure to refer to your multimeter's  user manual.
