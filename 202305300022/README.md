# Clock Bus

The clock bus is a wire that is simply pulled high and low in a continuous fashion to set a clock speed, typically done by the transmitter. Each time the transmitter pulls the line high and then low is one cycle.  

# 5 modes of clock speed:
1. **Standard-Mode** (Sm): 100 kbit/s
2. **Fast-Mode** (Fm): 400 kbit/s
3. **Fast-Mode Plus** (Fm+): 1 Mbit/s
4. **High-speed Mode** (Hs-mode): 3.4 Mbit/s
5. **Ultra-Fast Mode** (UFm): 5 Mbit/s
