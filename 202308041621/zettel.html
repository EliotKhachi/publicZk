        <p>There are two ways to escape <a href="../202308040127/README.md">The Scarcity Mindset</a>:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Acquire ultimate power. No one can contest your desires or needs. Curse God.</li>
        <li>Let go of your earthly desires and conquer your fear of death. Surrender to God. [<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+23%3A1-6&amp;version=ESV">Psalm of David</a>]</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Option #1 isn't a complete escape. No matter how much power you think you have, you will never have complete control. The attempt to acquire power will cause bitterness and resentment, resulting from the feeling of a lack of control.</p>
        <p>Option #2 is the only way to escape the scarcity mindset no matter what your circumstances are.</p>
        <p>With that being said, most people let their current circumstances dictate their mindset [<a href="../202308041642/README.md">How Most People Live in Scarcity</a>].</p>
