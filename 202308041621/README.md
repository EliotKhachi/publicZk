# Escaping The Scarcity Mindset

We all operate in [the scarcity mindset](../202308040127) to some extent. I see two rather radical ways to escape it:  
1. Acquire ultimate power. No one can contest your desires or needs.  
2. Let go of your desires and conquer your fear of death. [[Psalm of David](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+23%3A1-6&version=ESV)]  

Option #1 isn't even practical. No matter how much power you think you have, there will always be someone with more of it. And your "allies" around you may try to usurp your power. You will never have complete control.  

Option #2 isn't that practical either, unless you're the Buddha or Jesus, or another religious figure-- but at least this path offers hope to live with love no matter your circumstance.  

With that being said, I think a more balanced approach is the following:[[How Most People Live in Scarcity](../202308041642)].
