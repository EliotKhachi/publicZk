# Escaping The Scarcity Mindset

There are two ways to escape [The Scarcity Mindset](../202308040127/README.md):  
1. Acquire ultimate power. No one can contest your desires or needs.  
2. Let go of your desires and the fear of death. Surrender to God. [[Psalm of David](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+23%3A1-6&version=ESV)]  

Option #1 isn't even a complete escape. No matter how much power you think you have, you will never have complete control. For example, you will always have enemies who will attempt and succeed at taking your power.  

Option #2 is the only context-independent way to escape the scarcity mindset.  

With that being said, most people let their current circumstances dictate their mindset. Most prisoners in a Nazi concentration camp were living in scarcity and that was arguably the best strategy to survive [[How Most People Escape the Scarcity Mindset](../202308041642/README.md)].
