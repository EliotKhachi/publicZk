# Escaping The Scarcity Mindset

There are two ways to escape [The Scarcity Mindset](../202308040127/README.md):  
1. Acquire ultimate power. No one can contest your desires or needs. Curse God.  
2. Let go of your earthly desires and conquer your fear of death. Surrender to God. [[Psalm of David](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+23%3A1-6&version=ESV)]  

Option #1 isn't a complete escape. No matter how much power you think you have, you will never have complete control. The attempt to acquire power will cause bitterness and resentment, resulting from feeling of a lack of control.  

Option #2 is the only circumstance-independent way to escape the scarcity mindset.  

With that being said, most people let their current circumstances dictate their mindset. Most prisoners in a Nazi concentration camp were living in scarcity and that was arguably the best strategy to survive [[How Most People Escape the Scarcity Mindset](../202308041642/README.md)].
