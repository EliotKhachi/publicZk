# CAD and PLM Software Suite
s
A software package that serves as the *one* place for design, MBSE [\[What is Model-Based Systems Engineering?\]](../202110052023), and PLM.


## Features
* Intuitive GUI  
* Requirement tracking  
* Schedule and cost tracking  
* Automated documentation generation  
* Shared online 3D model (similar to google docs) with saved revisions and branches (similar to git)  
* Design change propagation (enabled by SysML and machine learning)  
* 3D model to 2d drawing automation and vice versa  
* Engineering software tools integration (CAD Simulation, MatLab, Simulink, Excel) and engineering resources integration (search bar for more information about concepts in structural analysis,thermal analysis, control theory, electrical circuits, etc...)  

## Evaluation
This business idea was evaluated based on the [\[Ten Ways to Evaluate a Business\]](../202203182053):
Current guesses:
1. Urgency - 1  
2. Market Size - 10  
3. Pricing Potential - 8  
4. Cost of Customer Acquisition - 4  
5. Cost of Value Delivery - 2  
6. Uniqueness of Offer - 3  
7. Speed to Market - 2  
8. Upfront Investment - 10  
9. Upsell Potential - 6  
10. Evergreen Potential - 8  

**Total: 54 --> Has potential but won't be a success without a huge investment of energy and resources... plan accordingly.**
