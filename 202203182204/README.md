# Free CAD and PLM Software Suite
A web application that serves as the *one* place for design, MBSE [\[What is Model-Based Systems Engineering?\]](../202110052023), and PLM. It is free to use by all and is funded through ad revenue by manufacturers. 

## Features
* Intuitive GUI  
* Requirement tracking  
* Schedule and cost tracking  
* Automated documentation generation  
* Shared online 3D model (similar to google docs) with saved revisions and branches (similar to git)  
* Design change propagation (enabled by SysML and machine learning)  
* 3D model to 2d drawing automation and vice versa  
* Engineering software tools integration (CAD Simulation, MatLab, Simulink, Excel) and engineering resources integration (search bar for more information about concepts in structural analysis,thermal analysis, control theory, electrical circuits, etc...)  

## Problems
1. How would we sell to customers over the competitors? Why should customers make the switch? How can we make the transition as smooth as possible?  
2. How much would it cost to create a product like this? How many man hours of software engineers would it take?  


## Evaluation
This business idea was evaluated based on the [\[Ten Ways to Evaluate a Business\]](../202203182053):
Current guesses:
1. Urgency - 3  
2. Market Size - 10  
3. Pricing Potential - 4  
4. Cost of Customer Acquisition - 4  
5. Cost of Value Delivery - 2  
6. Uniqueness of Offer - 10  
7. Speed to Market - 2  
8. Upfront Investment - 10  
9. Upsell Potential - 10  
10. Evergreen Potential - 10  

**Total: 65 --> Has potential but won't be a success without a huge investment of energy and resources... plan accordingly.**
