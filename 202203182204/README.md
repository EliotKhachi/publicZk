# CAD and PLM Software Suite

A software package that serves as the *one* place for design, MBSE [\[What is Model-Based Systems Engineering?\]](../202110052023), and PLM.


## Features
* Intuitive GUI  
* Requirement tracking  
* Schedule and cost tracking  
* Automated documentation generation  
* Shared online 3D model experience with saved revisions and branches (think of a shared docs and a git but for 3D design)  
* Design change propagation (enabled by SysML and machine learning)  
* 3D model to 2d drawing automation and vice versa  
* Engineering software tools integration (CAD Simulation, MatLab, Simulink, Excel) and engineering resources integration (search bar for more information about concepts in structural analysis,thermal analysis, control theory, electrical circuits, etc...)
