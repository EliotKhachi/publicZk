<h1 id="a-target-in-a-makefile">A Target in a Makefile</h1>
<p>A <em>target</em> is written in the beginning of a <em>rule</em>. A conventional target is the name of the file that is generated by a program. It is immediately followed by a <code>:</code> and the <em>prerequisites</em> <a href="../202110182309">[A Prerequisite in a Makefile]</a>, and then a new line, a tab, and the <em>recipe</em> <a href="../202110182310">[A Recipe in a Makefile]</a>. Examples of targets are executable <code>.bin</code> or object <code>.o</code> files.</p>
<p>Makefiles don’t know the difference between a conventional target and a <em>pseudo target</em> that are useful for maintaining the project. For example, a commonly used psuedo target is shown below:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode mk"><code class="sourceCode makefile"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="dv">clean:</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>    rm -rf *.o *.bin</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Above is a rule whose target is <em>clean</em> but it doesn’t have any prerequisites and does not create any files. Instead when <code>make clean</code> is called, it simply removes all object and executable files, thereby <em>cleaning</em> the directory of the files generated by <code>make</code>, leaving you with just the source files that you started with.</p>
