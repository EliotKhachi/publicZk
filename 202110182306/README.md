# A Target in a Makefile

See [Makefiles](../202110182235) for context.  

A *target* is written in the beginning of a *rule*. A conventional target the name of a file that is generated by a program. It is immediately followed by a `:` and *prerequisites* [\[A Prerequisite in a Makefile\]](../202110182309). Examples of targets are executable `.bin` or object `.o` files.  

Makefiles don't know the difference between a conventional target and a target used as an action to carry out. For example, a commonly used target is shown below:
```mk
clean:
	rm -rf *.o *.bin
```

Above is a rule whose target is *clean* but it doesn't have any prerequisites and does not create any files. Instead when `make clean` is called, it undos `make` by removing all object and executable files.
