# A Target in a Makefile

A *target* is written in the beginning of a *rule*. A conventional target is the name of the file that is generated by a program. It is immediately followed by a `:` and *prerequisites* [\[A Prerequisite in a Makefile\]](../202110182309). Examples of targets are executable `.bin` or object `.o` files.

Example:  
```mk
hellomake: hellomake.c hellofunc.c
		gcc -o hellomake hellomake.c hellofunc.c -I.
```

---

Makefiles don't know the difference between a conventional target and a *pseudo target* that are useful for maintaining the project. For example, a commonly used target is shown below:
```mk
clean:
	rm -rf *.o *.bin
```

Above is a rule whose target is *clean* but it doesn't have any prerequisites and does not create any files. Instead when `make clean` is called, it simply removes all object and executable files, thereby *cleaning* the directory of the files generated by `make`, leaving you with just the source files that you started with.
