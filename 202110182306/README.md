# A Target in a Makefile

A *target* is written in the beginning of a rule. It is immediately followed by a `:` and *prerequisites* \[[A Prerequisite in a Makefile](../202110182309)\]. Examples of targets are executable or object files. Targets can also be the name of an action to carry out, such as *clean* (a rule that undoes the file generation of the makefile, i.e. `rm -rf *.o *.bin`)  

 

See [Makefiles](../202110182235) for context.
