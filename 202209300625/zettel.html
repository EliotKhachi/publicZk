        <p><strong>Channel Binding</strong> is the process of <em>binding</em> the lower encryption channel to the higher application channel for cross-directional authentication.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Consider the following situation:</p>
        <p>Alice wants to log into Bob's server. She sends a hashed version of her password, but there was a <em>man-in-the-middle attack</em>, and Bob didn't get it. Instead, the attacker did. Thankfully, the password was hashed so the attacker couldn't decipher it. But still, Bob didn't receive it.</p>
        <p>For solving this, Bob registers himself to a certificate authority (CA), which signs his certificate. Alice <em>could</em> solely rely on that signature system, but she knows it has weaknesses. To give her additional assurance that there is no man-in-the-middle attack, Bob creates a proof that he knows the password (or a salted hash thereof), and includes his certificate into this proof. This inclusion is called <strong>channel binding</strong>, as the lower encryption channel is 'bound' to the higher application channel.</p>
        <p>Alice then has an authentication of Bob, and Bob has authentication of Alice. Taken together, they have mutual authentication.</p>
