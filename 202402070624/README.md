# NonTerminal Symbols

Nonterminal symbols are those symbols that can be replaced. They may also be called *syntactic variables*. A formal grammar includes a *start symbol*. The start symbol is the starting point to be replaced by successive applications of the production rules. The *language* defined by a grammar is precisely the set of terminal strings [[Terminal Symbols](../202402070511)] that can be so derived; this set can easily be infinite. See [Example Grammars Denoted in EBNF Notation](../202402070641) for how an infinite language set can be derived from simple grammar rules.
