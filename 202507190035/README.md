# The Way Of THe Superior Man

## Notes
- A man's ultimate drive is to be on a mission, achieve freedom and relaxation, and open up his woman and the world through the masculine gift of presence and consciousness  
- A man must know where he is, where he is going, and how to get there.  
- A woman's ultimate drive is to find a man who can satiate her unsatiable desire for love through the feminine gift of life and radiance  
- If you don't have purpose, then live at the masculine edge: cultivate austerity and challenge in your life; Take away all the comforts and cushions in your life-- and challenge yourself to conquer your fears, and set consequences for your failures
