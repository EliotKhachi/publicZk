# MBSE Current State of The Art

## Current State Of The Art (Competitors)
* Cameo Systems Modeler - ~$60k per year per license to use --> supports model-generat
ion and requirement management. Also supports exporting the model as an XML file.
* Ansys ModelCenter - ~$80k per year per license to use --> supports model integrations with analysis and data.
* Dassault Systems - Unknown
* Siemens - Unknown

Current competitors license modeling software to engineering firms and support various
 functions (may require additional plug-ins at additional costs):
 * Requirement definition and traceability
 * Model generation
 * Model integration with analysis and data
 * Model-generated documents

 *Keep in mind that the international council of system enginers (INCOSE) has been pushing for MBSE adoption since 2011. It has not yet been adopted deeply nor widely. Part of the question I'm trying to answer is why hasn't it been adopted yet? Why is it so difficult?*[Hypothesis on MBSE Organizational Shift](../202312110356).
