Current competitors license modeling software to engineering firms and support various
 functions (may require additional plug-ins at additional costs):  
 * Requirement definition and traceability
 * Model generation
 * Model integration with analysis and data
 * Model-generated documents

 *Keep in mind that the international council of system enginers (INCOSE) has been pushing for MBSE adoption since 2011. It has not yet been adopted deeply nor widely. Part of the question I'm trying to answer is why hasn't it been adopted yet? Why is it so difficult?* [Hypothesis on MBSE Organizational Shift](../202312110356).
