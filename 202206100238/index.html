<p>A <em>key pair</em>, consisting of a public key and a private key, is a set of security credentials used to prove your identity when connecting to an Amazon EC2 instance. This allows you to securely SSH into your instance.</p>
<p><strong>Store your private key in a secure place!!</strong></p>
<p>When you boot your instance for the first time, the public key will be added to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.</p>
