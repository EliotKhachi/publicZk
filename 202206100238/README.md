# Amazon EC2 key pairs and Linux instances

A *key pair*, consisting of a public key and a private key, is a set of security credentials used to prove your identity when connecting to an Amazon EC2 instance. This allows you to securely SSH into your instance.  

**Store your private key in a secure place!!**

When you boot your instance for the first time, the public key will be added to ~/.ssh/authorized\_keys.
