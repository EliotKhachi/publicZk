<p>Requirements are statements that must have a <em>subject</em> and a <em>measureable value</em> or characteristic. They can define a capability, attribute, or process that the system must perform, have, or follow, respectively. They can also define constraints on design, cost, or schedule. They must be written in a way that is conducive to uniform interpretation.</p>
<h2 id="key-words">Key Words</h2>
<p><strong>Shall</strong> Requirements help set constraints and define boundaries of the design space and objective space</p>
<p><strong>Should</strong> Requirements set goals once <strong>shall</strong> requirements are satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>System Level</strong> Requirements are the highest level of requirements, or customer requirements, generally extracted from the <em>request for proposal</em> (RFP).</p>
<p>** Derived** Requirements are the requirements derived from the system level requirements through trade studies, analysis &amp; simulation, testing, and iteration.</p>
