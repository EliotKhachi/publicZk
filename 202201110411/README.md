# Basics of Requirements  

Requirements are statements that must have a *subject* and a *measureable value* or characteristic. They can define a capability, attribute, or process that the system must perform, have, or follow, respectively. They can also define constraints on design, cost, or schedule. They must be written in a way that is conducive to uniform interpretation.


## Key Words
**Shall** Requirements help set constraints and define boundaries of the design space and objective space

**Should** Requirements set goals once **shall** requirements are satisfied.

**System Level** Requirements are the highest level of requirements, or customer requirements, generally extracted from the *request for proposal* (RFP).

** Derived** Requirements are the requirements derived from the system level requirements through trade studies, analysis & simulation, testing, and iteration.
