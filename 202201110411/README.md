# Basics of Requirements 

Requirements are statements that must have a *subject* and a *measureable value* or characteristic. They can define a capability, attribute, or process that the system must perform, have, or follow, respectively. They can also define constraints on design, cost, or schedule. They must be written in a way that is conducive to uniform interpretation.


## Key Words
**Shall** Requirements help set constraints and define boundaries of the design space and objective space

**Should** Requirements set goals once **shall** requirements are satisfied.

**System Level** Requirements are the highest level of requirements, or customer requirements, generally extracted from the *request for proposal* (RFP).

** Derived** Requirements are the requirements derived from the system level requirements through trade studies, analysis & simulation, testing, and iteration.

## Types of Requirements
1. Functional - What functions need to be performed to accomplish the objectives?
2. Performance - How well do these functions need to be performed? Identify minimum acceptable values for the system to carry out the mission or the baseline level of performance desired.
3. Interface - How will the design elements interact with each other?
4. Environmental - What environment will operations take place in?
5. Reliability - What is the desirable or maximum-allowable rate of system failure. How much redundancy does the system need to mitigate *mission* failure?
6. Safety - How much redundancy does the system need to mitigate *catastrophic* failure
7. Other - Producibility, maintainability, disposability, availability, upgradeability, human factors, etc.
