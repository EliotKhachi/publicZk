<li>What are the differences and advantages/disadvantages of server-side routing and client-side routing respectively?<br />
The disadvantage of server-side routing is that every time the client browses to a different web page, he/she requests any data, JS, CSS, and HTML pages from the server. The advantage of client-side routing is that no network requests are necessary. Instead, the bundle of JS, CSS, and HTML content is pre-loaded into the browser’s cache, and the web application selectively renders UI components. The disadvantage of client-side routing is the load time of initially opening the website, since you need to load in all the web content. The best approach is a balanced one, made much easier by React frameworks such as NextJS or Gatsby.<br />

<li>What is the benefit/purpose of installing React Router?<br />
The purpose of React Router is to make it easier for developers to set up routes to different webpages and to selectively render content.<br />
</li>
<li>How do we install React Router?<br />
Do <code>npm install react-router-dom@X</code> at your node project’s base directory (where <code>package.json</code> resides), where <code>X</code> is the version number.<br />
</li>
<li>What components are provided by React Router for basic routing needs?<br />
The <code>&lt;Router&gt;</code> component is the outermost wrapper of your application. It manages your routes. Within that you have <code>&lt;Switch&gt;</code>, another wrapper where you define your routes. Then you have <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code>, the component that contains the contents of your UI componenet, and sets the <code>path</code> property that sets the URL path of your UI component.<br />
</li>
<li>How do we implement a ‘404’ or ‘Not Found’ page?<br />
React Router by default directs the client to the ‘Home’ page if it can’t find the Route. To direct the client to a ‘404’ page, first set up a <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> that contains your ‘404’ page content, where the <code>path</code> property isn’t set to anything. Without a path defined, this is the default page of your app. Next, you have to modify your ‘Home’ page’s route declaration to <code>&lt;Route exact path="/"&gt;</code></li>
