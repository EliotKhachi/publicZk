# Introduction to Docker

Docker is a software that helps manage application compatibility with libraries, dependencies, and operating systems.

## Containers  
[\[Docker Containers\]](../202204302232) are used to house and "package" an application. Developers can then run those containers on any operating system by configuring your Docker based on your operating system or virtual machine.

## Images
Docker configurations are templates that are used to create one or more containers, and are called [\[Docker Images\]](../202204302243).
