# Introduction to Docker

The purpose of *docker* is to make an application's dependencies more manageable.  
## Containers  
In the context of using docker, applications live inside [\[Docker Containers\]](../202204302232). Containers house and "package" an application with the libraries/dependencies it requires. Developers can then run those containers on any machine and not have to worry about what libraries or versions thereof the machine is using, because everything is *contained* in the docker container.  

## Images
[\[Docker Images\]](../202204302243) are used to configure the dependencies of a container.
