# Lower-Self Motivations

Lower-self motivations stem from a selfish, insecure, and petty place. They are an unhealthy, corrupt expression of our psychological needs [[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs)].  

We are not always perfect. Our lower-self has its own motivations and sometimes it can take control. Nonetheless, when we are at our worst, we can channel those motivations to point us where we want to go.

## Examples
1. Seeking revenge for someone's wrong doing.  
2. Desire for validation from other people.  
3. Stroking your pride or ego.  
4. Desire to prove people wrong.
