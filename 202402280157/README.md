# Lower-Self Motivations

We are not always perfect. Sometimes, our lower-self perks up with its motivations and grabs our attention. These motivations stem from a selfish, insecure, and petty place. They are an unhealthy, corrupt expression of our psychological needs [[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs)].  

## Examples
1. Seeking revenge for someone's wrong doing.  
2. Desire for validation from other people.  
3. Stroking your pride or ego.  
4. Desire to prove people wrong.
