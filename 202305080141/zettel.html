        <h1 id="series-and-parallel">Series and Parallel</h1>
        <p>The terms <em>series</em> and <em>parallel</em> are used to describe a component's relationship to another component inside of a circuit.</p>
        <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>The appliances in your house. If you disconnect your toaster, your referigerator is still going to work. --&gt; PARALLEL</li>
        <li>Consider a string of Christmas lights. If just one light burns out, then none of the lights will turn on. --&gt; SERIES</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="series-circuit">Series Circuit</h2>
        <p>When two or more components are in series with each other, there is only one path for the electricity to travel between them. A circuit that only contains components in series only has a single loop. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=series+circuit&amp;t=newext&amp;atb=v344-1&amp;ia=images&amp;iax=images&amp;iai=http%3A%2F%2Felectricalacademia.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F08%2FCurrent-Level-is-the-Same-in-All-Parts-of-the-Circuit.gif">Example</a></p>
        <p><strong>Characteristics</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>The Current (I) across each component in the circuit is the same.</li>
        <li>The Voltage (V) across each component is different.</li>
        <li>The total resistance is <code>R_tot = R1 + R2 + R3 + ... + RN</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Adding a resistor in series increases the total resistance, thereby decreasing the total current through the circuit.</p>
        <h2 id="parallel-circuit">Parallel Circuit</h2>
        <p>When two or more components are in parallel with each other, the flow of electricity branches off between them. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=parallel+circuit&amp;t=newext&amp;atb=v344-1&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images&amp;iai=http%3A%2F%2Felectricalacademia.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F08%2F6.5a-2.gif">Example</a></p>
        <p><strong>Characteristics</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>The Voltage (V) across each component in the circuit is the same.</li>
        <li>The Current (I) across each component is different.</li>
        <li>The total resistance is <code>1/R_tot = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + ... + 1/RN</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Adding a resistor in parallel decreases the total resistance, thereby increasing the total current through the circuit.</p>
        <h2 id="series-parallel-circuits">Series-Parallel Circuits</h2>
        <p>It is rare for a circuit to be entirely composed of components in parallel, or of components all in series. More commonly, circuits contain portions in series and in parallel. Any single <em>set</em> of components that are in series or in parallel with each other can be <em>reduced</em> to a single component (resistance) by leveraging the characterstics of series and parallel circuits discussed previously.</p>
