# Series and Parallel

## Series
A Series circuit is one that only has one loop. There is only one path for the electricity to travel through.   

**Properties**
* The Current (I) across each resistor in the circuit is the same.   
* The Voltage (V) across each resistor is different.  
* The total resistance is `R_tot = R1 + R2 + R3 + ... + RN`
* Adding a resistor in series increases the total resistance, thereby decreasing the total current through the circuit.  

## Parallel
A Parallel circuit is one with multiple paths for the electricity to flow through.  
**Properties** 
* The Voltage (V) across each resistor in the circuit is the same.   
* The Current (I) across each resistor is different.  
* The total resistance is `1/R_tot = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + ... + 1/RN`  
* Adding a resistor in parallel decreases the total resistance, thereby increasing the total current through the circuit.  

## Examples
* The appliances in your house. If you disconnect your toaster, your referigerator is still going to work. --> PARALLEL 
* Consider a string of Christmas lights. If just one light burns out, then none of the lights will turn on. --> SERIES
