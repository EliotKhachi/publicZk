# Series and Parallel 

The terms *series* and *parallel* are used to describe a component's relationship to another component inside of a circuit. 

## Examples
* The appliances in your house. If you disconnect your toaster, your referigerator is still going to work. --> PARALLEL 
* Consider a string of Christmas lights. If just one light burns out, then none of the lights will turn on. --> SERIES 

## Series Circuit
When two or more components are in series with each other, there is only one path for the electricity to travel between them. A circuit that only contains components in series only has a single loop. [Example](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=series+circuit&t=newext&atb=v344-1&ia=images&iax=images&iai=http%3A%2F%2Felectricalacademia.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F08%2FCurrent-Level-is-the-Same-in-All-Parts-of-the-Circuit.gif)

**Characteristics**
* The Current (I) across each component in the circuit is the same.   
* The Voltage (V) across each component is different.  
* The total resistance is `R_tot = R1 + R2 + R3 + ... + RN`  

Adding a resistor in series increases the total resistance, thereby decreasing the total current through the circuit.  

## Parallel Circuit
When two or more components are in parallel with each other, the flow of electricity branches off between them. [Example](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=parallel+circuit&t=newext&atb=v344-1&iax=images&ia=images&iai=http%3A%2F%2Felectricalacademia.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F08%2F6.5a-2.gif)  

**Characteristics** 
* The Voltage (V) across each component in the circuit is the same.   
* The Current (I) across each component is different.  
* The total resistance is `1/R_tot = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + ... + 1/RN`  

Adding a resistor in parallel decreases the total resistance, thereby increasing the total current through the circuit.  

## Series-Parallel Circuits
It is rare for a circuit to be entirely composed of components in parallel, or of components all in series. More commonly, circuits contain portions in series and in parallel. Any single *set* of components that are in series or in parallel with each other can be *reduced* to a single component (resistance) by leveraging the characterstics of series and parallel circuits discussed previously.  

For [example](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=parallel+circuit&t=newext&atb=v344-1&iax=images&ia=images&iai=http%3A%2F%2Felectricalacademia.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F10%2FFigure-2-Series-Parallel-Circuit-1.gif), R2 and R3 are in parallel and are combined into R\_eq by using the formula 1/R\_eq = 1/R2 + 1/R3. In [this example](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=parallel+circuit&t=newext&atb=v344-1&iax=images&ia=images&iai=https%3A%2F%2Felectricalacademia.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F10%2FFigure-5-Currents-and-Voltages-in-Series-Parallel-CIrcuit.gif), R2 and R3 can be combined into R\_eq using the formula R\_eq = R2 + R3.
