# Hydrostatic Pressure  

The hydrostatic pressure is not actually a pressure but represents the change in pressure possible due to potential energy variations of the fluid as a result of elevation changes.

Definition of hydrostatic pressure: **p_hydrostatic = γz**, where γ is the specific weight of the fluid, and z is the elevation with respect to a reference elevation.
