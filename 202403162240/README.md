# AWS Key Management Service

AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is a managed service for creating and controlling cryptographic keys. KMS uses hardware security modules (HSM) to protect and validate cryptographic keys in accordance with the [FIPS 140-2 Cryptographic Module Validation Program](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/4523)  

KMS integrates with AWS Cloudtrail to log use of your KMS keys.  
KMS also integrates with many [other AWS services](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/features/#AWS_Service_Integration)to encrypt your data, including Amazon Aurora, DynamoDB, EBS, Route 53, Code Pipeline, ElastiCache, Redshift, and [AWS Machine Learning and AI Services](../202403162249)
