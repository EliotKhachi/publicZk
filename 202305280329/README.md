# What is a Signal

A signal in electronics is used to transmit information in electronics and is typically characterized by voltage over time. The signal can be [Alternating Current (AC)  ](../202110281820/README.md) or [Direct Current (DC) ](../202110281823/README.md).  

## Examples/Types
* **High** - A constant DC signal of VCC or High voltage.  
* **Low** - A constant DC signal of low or no voltage.  
* **Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM)** - A DC signal that alternates from high to low over time.
