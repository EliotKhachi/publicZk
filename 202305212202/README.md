# Standard Input

Often times, commands require an input.  

When an input isn't given, the shell prompts you for one, waiting for you to type it out, finishing with `Ctrl-d`.  

This is referred to as *standard input*.

## Example,
`$ wc -l` *command*  
*shell prompts you for an input:*
```
hello
my
name
is
Eliot
```
*press `Ctrl-d` to submit*  
`4` *output*
