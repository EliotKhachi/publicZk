# Principles of Building AI Agents

## Choosing a model
Prototype with hosted, and the MOST powerful models. Worry about infra issues, cost, and latency after you have something working.  

## Prompting
* The more examples you add to the prompt, the better the results, but the slower the results too.  
* Formatting can make a big difference. Experiment with CAPITALIZATION, \<xml-tags\> and structured / sectioned prompts

## Building Agents
* There is a spectrum of autonomy when it comes to agents
* Give clear descriptions to tools describing purpose and usage.
