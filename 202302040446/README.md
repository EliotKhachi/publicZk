# Media Formats - Web vs Android vs iOS 

## Introduction
Media formats are file types used to store digital media content such as audio, video, images, and text.

On the web, popular media formats include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and multimedia formats like JPEG, PNG, GIF, MP3, MP4, and WebM. Modern web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari provide native support for these formats, meaning they can play or display these formats without the need for additional software.
