# Be Nervous When Fighting Another Person

**No matter what the situation is, no matter how confident or strong you are, how small or seemingly weak the other person is, you never completely know what that person is capable of.**  

With this in mind, if you fear death, then it is perfectly natural to have some nerves when confronted with physical altercations. To be otherwise is to be incongruent with one's self [Living in Congruence With One's Self](https://github.com/EliotKhachi//publicZk/tree/main/202307310121).  

With that being said, it's best to avoid these situations entirely. If you find yourself in one, then try to de-escalate or flee. If neither of those options work, then defend yourself and try to partially incapacitate the offender until you are in a safe position.  

Conflict with another man becomes more complicated and delicate to handle due to the egos involved and social pressure. You do not want to avoid physical altercations too eagerly, for doing so would make you a bigger target and could tarnish your reputation.
