# Be Wary of Physical Altercations

## The Rule
**No matter what the situation is, no matter how confident or strong you are, how small or seemingly weak the other person is, you never completely know what that person is capable of.**  

## Fear of Death
Following from this rule, if you have some fear of death, then it is perfectly natural to have nerves during a conflict that can lead to a physical altercation. To be otherwise is to be incongruent with one's self [Living in Congruence With One's Self](../202307310121).  

With that being said, it's best to avoid these situations entirely by de-escalating or fleeing. If, despite your efforts, the situation has gotten physical, then defend yourself or try to partially incapacitate the offender until you are in a dominant or safe position.  

## Exceptions To The Rule 
**Conflict with another man** - Handle this situation delicately. Due to the egos involved and social pressure, you do not want to avoid physical altercations too eagerly. Doing so would make you a bigger target, and could tarnish your reputation. Neither outcome is a fruitful one.  
**Protecting loved ones** - Regardless of the egos involves or the social pressure present, do whatever it takes to ensure their safety.  
**Fulfilling your needs or desires** - There may be times when you are willing to put your life on the line in order to fulfill a need or desire. Carefully assess the risks and rewards.
