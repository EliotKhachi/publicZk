# Blockchain

A *blockchain* is a network of nodes that make transactions on decentralized database, or *ledger*.  

Using electronic cash and online payments as an example, what problems does it solve and how does it compare with centralized approaches?   
**Problem 1 - Trust Between Nodes In a Network**: If nodes attempted to transact with one, each node is incentivized to falsify the database records for their gain.  
**Centralized Solution**: Funnel all transaction requests through a centralized, trusted 3rd party that facilitates the transactions for the nodes.  
**Blockchain Solution**: Make it extremely difficult for any node or group of nodes to falsify records by maintaining a chain of cryptographic signatures.  

**Problem 2 - Double-Paying**: In a large network, it is not uncommon for multiple transaction requests to happen simultaneously. In this scenario, it is possible for someone to pay with cash they do not have.  
**Centralized Solution**: Funnel all transaction requests through a centralized, trusted 3rd party to decide which ones came in first.  
**Blockchain Solution**: Use a timestamp server to publicly announce the time of each transaction. The actual time of each transaction is determined based on consensus by the majority of the nodes on the network.
