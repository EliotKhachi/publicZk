# Blockchain

Before digging into what *blockchain* is, let's define the problems it is solving compared to traditional solutions, using electronic cash and online payments as an example. 

**Problem 1 - Trust Between Nodes In a Network**: If nodes attempted to transact with one, each node is inherently incentivized to falsify records for monetary gain.  
**Centralized Solution**: Funnel all transaction requests through a centralized, trusted 3rd party that facilitates the transaction.  
**Blockchain Solution**: Make it extremely difficult for any node or group of nodes to falsify records.  

**Problem 2 - Double-Paying**: In a large network, it is not uncommon or unusual for multiple nodes to initiate multiple transaction requests simultaneously. In this scenario, it is possible for someone to pay with cash they do not have.  
**Centralized Solution**: Funnel all transaction requests through a centralized, trusted 3rd party that decides which ones came in first.  
**Blockchain Solution**: Use a timestamp server to publicly announce the time of each transaction. The actual time of each transaction is determined based on consensus by the majority of the nodes on the network.
