<h2 id="step-1">Step 1</h2>
<p>Plan the function of the circuit. Define requirements. Create Block Diagram without specific components.</p>
<p>e.g.Â Create a microcontroller based circuit that reads the position of a joystick and sends the values through the RF band to a receiver. The circuit must be powered through a LiPo Battery.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> * Read power delivery data and joystick data and outputs signals through RF band to a receiver. * MCU * Joystick position signal and ADC * Receiver and ADC<br />
* Deliver Power Using LiPo Battery * LiPo Battery * LiPo Charge Controller * Micro USB Port to charge LiPo Battery through LiPo Charge Controller * Power Switch * 3.3V Regulator * Deliver Power Safely - MCU reads input pin voltage reading from voltage divider and checks if 3.4V is exceeded to shut off RF functionality and notify user through LED. * Voltage divider * LED</p>
<h2 id="step-2">Step 2</h2>
<p>Select components and create paper schematic.</p>
<h2 id="step-3">Step 3</h2>
<p>Create proper schematic. * Add components to the editor and rearrange them ## Step 4 Design printed circuit board (PCB).</p>
