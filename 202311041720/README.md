# Virtual Machines

Virtual machines allow us to run applications, each in their own isolated environments, with a single physical machine.  

Virtual machines use a [Hypervisor](../202311041723) to compartmentalize a physical machine into smaller *virtual* machines. The hypervisor allocates each virtual machine resources, i.e. a certain amount of RAM, CPU cores, and hard disk storage.

## Limitations
* Each virtual machine needs a full blown OS, which is slow to boot-up and resource intensive. For a lightweight alternative, see [Docker Containers](../202311041731).
