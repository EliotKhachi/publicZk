# Docker Containers

Containers contain everything you need, aside from an operating system, to run your application. In fact, instead of an operating system, the container runs on an instance of a [\[Docker Image\]](../202204302243).  

## What's Inside a Container
1. **The actual application**
2. **The required libraries to run your application**
3. **The required dependencies to run your application**

The above three things are essentially all that is in a container.
