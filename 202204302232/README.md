# Docker Containers

Containers are bundles of isolated code that contains everything you need, aside from an operating system, to run your application.

## What's Inside a Container
1. **The actual application**
2. **The required libraries to run your application**
3. **The required dependencies to run your application**

The above three things are essentially all that is in a container.
