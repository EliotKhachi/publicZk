        <p>All the internet's servers communicate through what is known as Port 80. In order to enable your router to host a server on the internet, it must have enabled Port 80 as one of its forwarded ports.</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Go to your router's configuration settings online (For ASUS, go to router.asus.com)</p></li>
        <li><p>Navigate to the port forwarding page (this may be different depending on the router model, try checking under WAN.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add a new port forwarding configuration</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Make a name for this service</li>
        <li>Specify the External Port as 80 or a range from 80 to 80</li>
        <li>Select the Internal IP address as the LAN IP address of the machine that you are hosting your server on (192.168.1...)</li>
        <li>Select the Protocol to be TCP <em>and</em> UDP, (BOTH)</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>You're done! Save the settings. You can now host your server on the internet from your specified machine.</p></li>
