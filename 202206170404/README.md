# Configure Raspberry Pi to Host a Server

See Reference [1] to create your node application, host it on localhost:5000, and use nginx to serve the website to the web by proxing your machine's public ipv4 address to localhost:5000.  

See --> [202207030601](../202207030601) - Port Forwarding <-- to forward port 80 on your home router to your raspberry pi.

See Reference [2] to set up a VPN. Just kidding. See Reference [2] for why a VPN is unneccessary for security.

See Reference [3] to set up a cronjob to run your server when the raspberry boots.  
See Reference [4] to set up Cloudflare for DNS hosting
