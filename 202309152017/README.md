# AWS Auto Scaling Group (ASG)

## What
An Auto Scaling group contains a collection of EC2 instances. The core functionality of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service is to maintain the number of instances.  

## Why
Optimally meet the desired capacity required by your application, at any given time. This is a core principle of the cloud.  

## How
Perform periodic health checks on the instances in the group to maintain a fixed number of *healthy* instances. See [Scaling Strategies](../202309152039) for more information.
