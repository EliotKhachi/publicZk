# Development Workflow

We can take an application and *dockerize* so it can be run by docker. This small change can be done with a *Dockerfile*. A Dockerfile creates an image [[202205240219](../202205240219) - Docker Image]
r the app. 

We can then create a container using that image. The container is where we use to run our application locally.
