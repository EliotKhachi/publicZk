## EBS Volumes
EBS volumes are characterized by Size (Gb), Throughput (Bits/s), and IOPS (R/W operations per second)  
What is considered an "operation" with regards to volume IOPS capacity? Throughput is a rate of data change in bits/s. IOPS is a single number representing the maximum number of input/output operations per volume.
