# Variable Costs

*Variable costs* are costs that are directly proportional to how much a company sells their good or service.  

**Total Variable Cost = Total Quantity of Output x Variable Cost Per Unit of Output**  

In contrast to [Fixed Costs](../202312060355), variable costs change throughout the lifecycle of a project. Since variable costs are directly related to the output of a business, they are *never* [Indirect Costs](../202312060353) but can be [Direct Costs](../202312060352).  

## Examples
* raw materials
* direct labor
* commissions
* utilities
* shipping/freight
