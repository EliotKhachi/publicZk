HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It allows web developers to create and structure sections, paragraphs, and links on a website using *elements*, *tags*, and *attributes*.  

HTML is *NOT* a programming language since it doesn't introduce any dynamic functionality. Rather it is used to...
* design how a browser displays wep page elements such as text, hyperlinks, and media files  
* imbed hyperlinks so users can easily navigate related pages and websites  
* organize and format web pages
