# System Dynamic Analysis 

* System dynamic analysis studies the behavior of the system as it changes with time as opposed to the *steady-state* of constant operation with time.  

* The basic analytical approach for this type of analysis involves linear or non-linear mathematical modeling consisting of algebraic and integral-differential equations.
