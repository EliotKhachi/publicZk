<p><em>An examination of how U.S. manufacturing compares to other countries, the trends in the domestic industry, and the industry trends compared to those in other countries.</em></p>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manufacturing Industry Size</strong> - In 2020, the U.S. was the 2nd largest manufacturer, contributing to 16.6% of the total global manufacturing value added, while China was the largest manufacturing nation, contributing to 30.1% of the total global manufacturing value added.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Manufacturing Growth</strong> - U.S. manufacturing compound annual growth between 2015 and 2020 was 1.2%, putting the U.S. just under the 50th percentile.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Productivity</strong> - Productivity in the U.S. is relatively high, being ranked at 7th or 9th (depending on the measure used) in output per hour among 133 countries.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Economic Environment</strong> - There is no agreed upon measure for research, innovation, and other factors for doing business; the U.S. rankings in these areas vary widely. The Deloitte Global Manufacturing Index ranks China 1st and U.S. 2nd. The Competitiev Industrial Performance Index ranked the U.S. as 44th in the capacity to produce and export manufactured goods; technological deepening and upgrading; and world impact.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Types of Goods Produced</strong> - The largest manufacturing subsector in the U.S. is computer and electronic products followed by chemical manufacturing and food, beverage, and tobacco products.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Economic Disruptions</strong> - During the 2008 recession, the manufacturing value added declined more than the decline in total U.S. GDP. This resulted in the 2022-Q1 GPD to be 33.6% above 2005’s, while manufacturing was only 25.1% above 2005’s.</li>
<li><strong>Manufacturing Supply Chain Costs</strong> - The top 3 domestic supply chain entities ranked by value added are: 1) Petroleum refineries at $596.1B, 2) Oil and gas extraction at $516.1B, and 3) Management of companies and enterprises at $128.5B</li>
<li><strong>Manufacturing Safety, Compensation, and Profits</strong> - Employee compensation in manufacturing (including benefits) has had a 5-year compound annual growth of -2.1%, but remains 8.8% above total private industry compensation. Manufacturing fatalities and injury rates have been declining since 2002.</li>
