## Reasons to use a load balancer
1. Spread load across multiple downstream servers (in case of many simultaneous requests)  
2. Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application (the load balancer)  
3. Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances  
4. Do regular health checks to your instances
