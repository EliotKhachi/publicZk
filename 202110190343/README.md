# Basic Linux Commands

This is a list of basic Linux commands separated in categories. Keep in mind that each command can utilize options, -<alphabetical\_character>,separated by a space between each other.

## Navigation
1. pwd - prints the path of the current working directory.
2. cd <directory>- navigates through files and directories. Additional directories can be navigated through a single command by appending a '/' after the directory name, followed by the next directory name.
3. ls - prints the contents of the current working directory.
4. rm <filename(s)> - removes a single file.
	* Options:
	* -i - prompts to confirm each file before deleting it.
	* -f - remove files with prompting, even if they are write-protected using the -f (force) option
	* -v - verbose mode: tells the shell to provide confirmation/output/information/message when the command is executed.
	* -fv - force remove in verbose mode (Example of combining options).
	* -d - remove empty directory
	* -r - remove non-empty directory(s) and all files within them
	* -rf - *force* remove non-empty directory(s) and all files within them
