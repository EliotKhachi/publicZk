# MAX603/MAX604 Voltage Regulators

The MAX603 and MAX604 voltage regulators are a great choice for electronics hobbyists for their versatility and ease of use.  

## Key Features
**input range:** 2.7V to 11.5V.  
**output range:** 1.25V to 11V.  
**current output:** up to 500mA 

## Output Voltage Selection
The great thing about these regulators is that they have 2 modes of operation.  
**Preset Voltage Mode**
Select this mode by connecting the `SET` pin to ground. In this mode, the output of the MAX603 is set to 5V and the output of the MAX604 is set to 3.3V.  
**Adjustable Mode**
For an output voltage ranging from 1.25V to 11V, use two external resistors connected as a voltage divider to `SET`.
