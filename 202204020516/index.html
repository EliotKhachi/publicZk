<h1 id="selecting-a-data-structure">Selecting a Data Structure</h1>
<p>Data structures are used to organize, handle, and/or manipulate <em>multiple</em> elements of <em>primitive</em> or <em>complex</em> data types. To select a data structure, let’s identify our needs by asking some questions.</p>
<h2 id="questions-to-ask-yourself">Questions To Ask Yourself</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Will we be accessing the elements in a particular order?</p></li>
<li><p>Are any elements connected to each other in some way?</p></li>
<li><p>Are duplicates allowed?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It may not be obvious how to organize large pools of data; so, try to break up your data into chunks that fall into categories defined by yes/no answers to the questions above. E.g. <em>Some</em> elements need to be ordered, connected, unique, and <em>some</em> don’t.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-data-structures-categorized">Types of Data Structures, Categorized</h2>
<p><strong>Driven by Order</strong> * List - ordered sequence of elements. * Queue - a <em>list</em> where elements are processed in a FIFO fashion. * Stack - a <em>list</em> where elements are processed in a LIFO fashion. <strong>Driven by Uniqueness</strong> * Set - unordered collection of unique elements * Hash Table/Hash Map - a <em>set</em> whose elements are accessed using a key that “maps” to a value.<br />
<strong>Driven by Connectivity</strong> * Graph - unordered collection of linked/connected elements. Structure of connections can vary.<br />
* Tree - a graph where the structure of connections is hierarchical.</p>
