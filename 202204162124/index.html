<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Tube or pipe bending is a common manufacturing process used to construct anything from structures in the automotive industry such as strut tower braces, bash bars, roll cages, and roll bars, to plumbing fluid for aerospace applications or chemical plants.</p>
<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pipe</strong> - a hollowed-out cylinder of a pre-determined diameter and wall thickness.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Tube</strong> - a hollowed-out cylinder of a pre-determined diameter and wall thickness.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Bending die</strong> - Generally a die in the shape of a semi-circle with a groove of a various size wherein the pipe/tube sits inside to be bent.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Bender</strong> - Lever used to bend a <em>tube</em>.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Pre-loader</strong> - Securely holds the pipe in place against the bending die at the start of the bend, making it ready to bend.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Follower</strong> - Encloses the groove of the bending die after the pre-loader to hold the pipe between it and the groove during bending.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Frame</strong> - Attaches to the bender and the die via pins. A structure that carries the load from the bender to the die.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>CLR (Center-line radius)</strong> - the distance between the center of the bending die to the center-line of the pipe/tube.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="differences-between-tube-and-pipe">Differences Between Tube and Pipe</h2>
<p><strong>Tubes and Pipes are referred to differently.</strong> * Tube - Nominal size is designated by its <em>outer</em> diameter.<br />
* Pipe - Nominal size is designated by its <em>inner</em> diameter.</p>
<p><strong>Tubes and Pipes are bent differently.</strong> * Tube - The bending die is fixed in place by a pin (free to rotate) and the bending tool is cranked to <em>pull</em> or <em>draw</em> the tube <em>around</em> the die.<br />
* Pipe - The pipe is held in place and a hydraulic press forces the bending die into the center of the pipe, forcing the pipe to bend around the die.</p>
