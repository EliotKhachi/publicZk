# Read Write Own: Building the Next Era of the Internet

*Read Write Own* by Chris Dixon is a book for internet enthusiasts, technologists, developers, content creators, and everyday consumers.  

Chris starts by describing the origins of the internet and the opportunities it created thanks to the open and shared protocols built on top of it: web and email. He explains how and why corporate networks grew so large, and argues they changed the landscape of the internet for the worse. In the early days of the internet, the flow of information was balanced, not concentrated. Now, corporate networks like Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter control most of the internet traffic thanks to their convenience-- but at what cost? Well, they take 99% of the value generated by its content creators, giving them back a mere 1%. YouTube is the exception, where they give ~55% back.  

The book goes on to describe a different future-- one that solves the problems of bare protocol networks (lack of security and low-quality services) and the problems of corporate networks (concentrated power, unreliable network rules, and high take-rates)-- all thanks to blockchain technology. Blockchains distribute power back to the edge nodes-- the consumers, developers, and content creators-- and put the fate of the blockchain back in their hands, like the early days of the internet. A blockchain is like a city. Users vote to establish the rules of the game. These rules are fair (~50% majority) and reliable. They make up the backbone of a blockchain's economy: How do we incentivize consumers, content creators, and developers to use and contribute to the network? How do we compensate them? How do we "tax" them to sustain the network?  

Blockchain enables a virtual economy to flourish. You can build, buy, sell, mix, and re-compose services and virtual goods, all from the comfort of your home (your @handle) rather than somebody else's (a corporate marketplace/platform). This is the future of the internet, known as web3, that is now possible thanks to blockchain technology.
