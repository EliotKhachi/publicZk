# Types of Requirements 

1. **Functional** - What functions need to be performed to accomplish the objectives?  

2. **Performance** - How well do these functions need to be performed? Identify minimum acceptable values for the system to carry out the mission orthe baseline level of performance desired.  

3. **Interface** - How will the design elements interact with each other? i.e. nuts and bolts, flow of fluid, heat, or electricity, exchange of forces, loads, or torques, or all of the above.      

4. **Environmental** - What environment will operations take place in?  

5. **Reliability** - What is the desirable or maximum-allowable rate of system failure. How much redundancy does the system need to mitigate *mission* failure?    

6. **Safety** - How much redundancy does the system need to mitigate *catastrophic* failure.  

7. **Other** - Producibility, maintainability, disposability, availability,     upgradeability, human factors, etc.
