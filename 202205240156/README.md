# Containers vs Virtual Machines 

## Virtual Machines
Virtual machines is an abstraction of a machine or physical hardware. I.e. a mac running windows and linux using hypervisor (a software used to create and manage virtual machines).
* The benefit of this is that we can run applications in isolated environments (virtual machines) on a single physical machine.  
* **Problem 1**: Each VM needs a full blown OS --> Slow to start and resource intensive

## Containers
Gives us the same kind of isolation but they are more lightweight because they share the OS of the host.
