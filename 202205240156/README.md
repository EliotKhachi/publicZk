# Containers vs Virtual Machines 

## Virtual Machines
Virtual machines is an abstraction of a machine or physical hardware. I.e. a mac running windows and linux using hypervisor (a software used to create and manage virtual machines).
* **Pro**: We can run applications in isolated environments (virtual machines) on a single physical machine.  
* **Con**: Each VM needs a full blown OS, which is slow to boot-up and is resource intensive.  

## Containers
Gives us the same kind of isolation but they are more lightweight because they share the OS of the host.
