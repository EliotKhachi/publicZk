<h2 id="virtual-machines">Virtual Machines</h2>
<p>Virtual machines is an abstraction of a machine or physical hardware. I.e. a mac running windows and linux using hypervisor (a software used to create and manage virtual machines). * The benefit of this is that we can run applications in isolated environments (virtual machines) on a single physical machine.<br />
* <strong>Problem 1</strong>: Each VM needs a full blown OS â€“&gt; Slow to start and resource intensive</p>
<h2 id="containers">Containers</h2>
<p>Gives us the same kind of isolation but they are more lightweight because they share the OS of the host.</p>
