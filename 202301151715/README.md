# Useful NPM Commands 

## Version Control  
* `npm -v` - prints the version of npm being used.  
* `npm list` - lists the packages used in the project, labeling those *not* in the `package.json` file as *extraneous*.  
* `npm outdated` - very useful command. Lists packages and their Current, Wanted, and Latest versions. Also lists their location in the project and the project(s) that depend on them.
