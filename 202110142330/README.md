# Medical Care Facts to Check/Update By Milton Friedman 

## List of Statements to Fact-Check and Update to Today's Statistics
1. There has been an increase in government spending for medicare, medicaid, expenditures by the department of health, education, and welfare to a substantial portion of government budget.
2. Find other examples in industry where producers who profess their beliefs in free markets still manage to foster and produce government take-over, government regulation, government control. I.e. railroad entrpreneurs creating the Interstate Commerce Commission (historical case), steel industry in favor of tariffs (1970s). Large part of the pressure for socialized medicine has been due to the policies pushed by the American Medical Association (AMA)
3. Although initially it may seem that medical institutions gain additional resources by operating through gov't, this doesnt't last. When a government establishes regulatory commissions to operate overhead medical institutions, there are additional funds available because we have voted to birth this commission by cutting budget elsewhere or increasing federal income through taxes. --> GAP IN MY THINKING WHEN INTERPRETING MILTON <-- The newly established commission over time becomes starved of funds
e.g. Great Britain's socialized medicine was introduced after WW2. Estimates on spending for medical care before and after socialized medicine in britain, as well as estimated on spending for medical care in other countries, all show undisputably, that you would have a larger total sum of funds devoted to medical care if you did not have a provision for medicine under the state system.
