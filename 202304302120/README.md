# 5 Step Roadmap to Embedded Software Engineering 

## What is Embedded Software Engineering
Embedded software engineering is the practice of developing embedded systems.   
Embedded systems are computational units that are embedded electrical and mechanical devices that serve a specific purpose, for example:  
* The device in your coffee machine.  
* The control unit in your car that is responsible for deploying your airbags.  

All embedded systems have inputs and outputs. Your coffee machine is waiting to be turned on, waiting for the user to press a button to begin brewing, etc. Your car is 
constantly sensing for an impact that exceeds a certain threshhold value of force or deceleration to determine whether or not to deploy the airbags.  

## 1. Learn to Program in C  
First, learn how to program in C. Why?  
1. It is the first low-level language used in computer design.  
2. It is extremely versatile.  
3. It will teach you how computers operate.  
4. It is the most common language used in embedded system design.

## 2. Learn the Basics of Electronics
**What are the following things and how do they work?**  
* Resistor  
* Electromagnet  
* AC-to-DC Converter  
* Transistor  
* Servo Motor  
* Solenoid

## 3. Start With an Arduino
1. User friendly. It provides a lot of abstraction to the hardware functionality.  
2. Very large community. You'll find a lot of project ideas and hardware kits.

## 4. Use a Different Microcontroller
Go to the next level and use a more low-level microcontroller. Less libraries, more barebones, more code, and more versatile.
