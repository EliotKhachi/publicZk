        <h2 id="what-is-embedded-software-engineering">What is Embedded Software Engineering</h2>
        <p>Embedded software engineering is the practice of developing embedded systems.<br />
        Embedded systems are computational units that are embedded electrical and mechanical devices that serve a specific purpose, for example:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The device in your coffee machine.</li>
        <li>The control unit in your car that is responsible for deploying your airbags.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All embedded systems have inputs and outputs. Your coffee machine is waiting to be turned on, waiting for the user to press a button to begin brewing, etc. Your car is constantly sensing for an impact that exceeds a certain threshhold value of force or deceleration to determine whether or not to deploy the airbags.</p>
        <h2 id="1-learn-to-program-in-c">1. Learn to Program in C</h2>
        <p>Why?</p>
        <ol>
        <li>It is the first low-level language used in computer design.</li>
        <li>It is extremely versatile.</li>
        <li>It will teach you how computers operate.</li>
        <li>It is the most common language used in embedded system design.<br />

        <h2 id="3-start-with-an-arduino">3. Start With an Arduino</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>User friendly. It provides a lot of abstraction to the hardware functionality.</li>
        <li>Very large community. You'll find a lot of project ideas and hardware kits.<br />
        <em>SKIP (already did some work here)</em></li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="4-use-a-different-microcontroller">4. Use a Different Microcontroller</h2>
        <p>Go to the next level and use a more low-level microcontroller. Less libraries, more barebones, more code, and more versatile.<br />
