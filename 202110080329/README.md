# The Power of Small Simple Steps (S^3)  

## The Problem
We procrastinate all the time, but why? One of the main reasons why we don't do what we want to accomplish is because the "project" seems so big, distant, and impossible. Then when we struggle to get something done with some amount of regularity, we beat ourselves up over it. "Feeling guilty when you're away from work, when you aren't in a position to do anything about it, is not helpful, and can be painful" (Markman).

## The Solution
What is the smallest simple step I can take now? Breaking the task into bite-size pieces leads to habits that lead toward success.

After accomplishing each one of these smaller tasks, that bit of tension is released in your mind, you are closer to achieving your goal, and you are more likely to notice progress.

## Conclusion
Small simple steps repeated lead to habits. [202110080346](../202110080346) - Jim Kwik on Habits
