# Jim Kwik on the Power of Small Simple Steps (S^3) 

## Key Questions
What is the smallest simple step I can take now?

## The Zeigarnik Effect
The conclusion that uncompleted tasks create a level of tension that keeps that task at the front of our minds until it is completed.

## The Problem
The Zeigarnik effect is noticed on a daily basis in procrastination.

We procrastinate all the time, but why? One of the main reasons why we don't do what we want to accomplish is because the "project" seems so big, distant, and impossible. Then when we struggle to get something done with some amount of regularity, we beat ourselves up over it. "Feeling guilty when you're away from work, when you aren't in a position to do anything about it, is not helpful, and can be painful" (Markman).

## The Solution
Breaking the task into bite-size pieces leads to habits that lead toward success.

After accomplishing each one of these smaller tasks, that bit of tension is released in your mind, you are closer to achieving your goal, and you are more likely to notice progress.

## Conclusion
Small simple steps repeated lead to habits. [202110080346](../202110080346) - Jim Kwik on Habits
