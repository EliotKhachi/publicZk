<h1 id="inviscid-flow">Inviscid Flow</h1>
<p>All real flowing fluid imparts a fictional force onto the object(s) which surround and are in immediate contact with the fluid. This fictional force is associated with the shear stress and area of interaction. The shear stress is associated with viscosity.</p>
<p>Inviscid flow is a characterization of fluid wherein the flow is assumed to have no viscosity, and therefore zero friction effects. This characterization is appropriate when the frictional effects are negligible, i.e.Â slow flow inside of a large pipe with little surface roughness.</p>
