# GD&T Gage Design  

* The purpose of a gage is to test the mating components of a part to ensure they fit in assembly.

* It is good practice to have multiple gages around to test parts with in case one is lost or currently in use.

* Gages must be manufactured as close to the exact size of the virtual condition as possible. 

* **No matter the accuracy, however, gages will always either reject a few good parts or accept a few bad parts**. The design of the gage depends on whether it is more urgent to deny bad parts (emphasize quality) or to accept "acceptable" parts (emphasize quantity).
  
* A "Go, No-Go" Gage has one side that will fit and another side that will not to for testing maximum and minimum features of size.
