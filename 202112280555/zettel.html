        <li><p>The purpose of a gage is to test the mating components of a part to ensure they fit in assembly.</p></li>
        <li><p>It is good practice to have multiple gages around to test parts with in case one is lost or currently in use.</p></li>
        <li><p>Gages must be manufactured as close to the exact size of the virtual condition as possible.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>No matter the accuracy, however, gages will always either reject a few good parts or accept a few bad parts</strong>. The design of the gage depends on whether it is more urgent to deny bad parts (emphasize quality) or to accept "acceptable" parts (emphasize quantity).</p></li>
        <li><p>A "Go, No-Go" Gage has one side that will fit and another side that will not to for testing maximum and minimum features of size.</p></li>
