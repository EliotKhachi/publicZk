# A Recipe in a Makefile

A *recipe* is a set of command-line instructions that GNU *make* recognizes as belonging to a particular *target*. When a target is called, its recipe is executed.  

* A recipe may have more than one command.  

* There must be a tab character at the beginning of each recipe line.
