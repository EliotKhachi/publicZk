# HASEL Actuators 

## What are they?
Hasel actuators are devices that expand or contract to produce force. They have applications in soft robotics.  

## What are they made of?
A single Hasel actuator... 
1. is composed of an outer plastic/polymer shell  
2. is filled with a liquid dielectric  
3. has two electrodes on opposite sides of one half of the shell.  

The shell resembles a pouch that contains the liquid. The cathode and anode are placed across from each other on opposite sides of the pouch. 

## How do they work?
When there is a voltage difference between the electrodes, their charges cause them to attract. The pouch then gets squeezed by the electrodes coming together; thereby, shortening the length and creating a contraction.   

## Insights
Hasel acuators have the same structure as [Capacitors](../202305080332), and they both store charge. The difference between them is a matter of function. Hasel actuators use the attractive force caused by the difference in charge to cause displacement (contraction / expansion). Capacitors are meant to charge and discharge many times to smooth out current draw, for example.
