# HASEL Actuators

## What are they?
Hasel actuators are a soft, artificial muscle fibers that have applications in robotics.  

## What are they made of?
A single Hasel actuator... 
1. is composed of an outer, flexible plastic/polymer shell  
2. is filled with a liquid dielectric  
3. has two electrodes on opposite sides of one half of the shell - [Carbon Electrodes](../202304220219)

The shell resembles a pouch that contains the liquid. The cathode and anode are placed across from each other on opposite sides of the pouch. 

## How do they work?
When there is a voltage difference between the electrodes, their charges cause them to attract. The pouch then gets squeezed by the electrodes coming together; thereby, shortening the length and creating a contraction.
