# HASEL Actuators

## What are they?
Hasel actuators are a soft, artificial muscle fibers that have applications in robotics.  

## What are they made of?
A single Hasel actuator is composed of  
1. an outer, flexible plastic/polymer shell  
2. liquid dielectric  
3. two electrodes - [Carbon Electrodes](../202304220219)

The shell resembles a pouch that contains the liquid. The cathode and anode are placed across from each other on opposite sides of the pouch. 

## How do they work?
When a voltage is applied to the cathode, the cathode and anode are attracted to each other, thereby squeezing the pouch, shortening its length, and creating a contraction.
