        <h2 id="what-are-they">What are they?</h2>
        <p>Hasel actuators are devices that expand or contract to produce force. They have applications in soft robotics.</p>
        <h2 id="what-are-they-made-of">What are they made of?</h2>
        <p>A single Hasel actuator...</p>
        <ol>
        <li>is composed of an outer plastic/polymer shell</li>
        <li>is filled with a liquid dielectric</li>
        <li>has two electrodes on opposite sides of one half of the shell.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The shell resembles a pouch that contains the liquid. The cathode and anode are placed across from each other on opposite sides of the pouch.</p>
        <h2 id="how-do-they-work">How do they work?</h2>
        <p>When there is a voltage difference between the electrodes, their charges cause them to attract. The pouch then gets squeezed by the electrodes coming together; thereby, shortening the length and creating a contraction.</p>
        <h2 id="design-insight">Design Insight</h2>
        <p>Hasel acuators have the same structure as <a href="../202305080332/index.html">Capacitors</a>, and they both store charge. The difference between them is a matter of function. Hasel actuators use the attractive force caused by the difference in charge to cause displacement (contraction / expansion). Capacitors are meant to charge and discharge many times to smooth out current draw, for example.</p>
