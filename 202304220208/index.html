<h2 id="what-are-they">What are they?</h2>
<p>Hasel actuators are devices that expand or contract to produce force. They have applications in soft robotics.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-they-made-of">What are they made of?</h2>
<p>A single Hasel actuator… 1. is composed of an outer plastic/polymer shell<br />
2. is filled with a liquid dielectric<br />
3. has two electrodes on opposite sides of one half of the shell.</p>
<p>The shell resembles a pouch that contains the liquid. The cathode and anode are placed across from each other on opposite sides of the pouch.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-they-work">How do they work?</h2>
<p>When there is a voltage difference between the electrodes, their charges cause them to attract. The pouch then gets squeezed by the electrodes coming together; thereby, shortening the length and creating a contraction.</p>

<p>Hasel acuators have the same structure as <a href="../202305080332">Capacitors</a>, and they both store charge. The difference between them is a matter of function. Hasel actuators use the attractive force caused by the difference in charge to cause displacement (contraction / expansion). Capacitors are meant to charge and discharge many times to smooth out current draw, for example.</p>
