# Comparators 

A comparator has 3 leads:  
1. V+ input
2. V- input 
3. V\_out

Simply put, V\_out is HIGH if V+ > V- and LOW if V+ < V-. [HIGH and LOW Voltages](../202305121857)

## Symbol
A comparator looks like a triangle with 2 inputs at the base, + and -, and 1 output at the tip. On the triangle there is also a letter or number to label the comparator.
