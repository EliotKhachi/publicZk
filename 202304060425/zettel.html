        <p>OpenAI's APIs consist of a simple, flexible, and extremely powerful interface.<br />
        Its usage consists of the following: you input text as a <strong>prompt</strong>, and the API will return a text <strong>completion</strong> that attempts to match whatever instructions or context you gave it.</p>
        <p>i.e. prompt: <em>Suggest one name for a horse</em>; completion: <em>Flippy</em></p>
        <ul>
        <li>You can fine-tune the model to give you a more tailored completion by giving examples to communicate patterns or nuances.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>i.e. prompt: <em>Suggest three names for an animal that is a superhero.</em>; manually suggested completion: <em>Animal: Cat Names: Captain Sharpclaw, Names: Captain Sharpclaw, Agent Fluffball, The Incredible Feline Animal: Dog Names: Ruff the Protector, Wonder Canine, Sir Barks-a-Lot Animal: Horse Names:</em></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Another way to control the API's completions is by adjusting the <strong>temperature</strong>.<br />
        A temperature of <strong>0</strong> tells the model to be confident, accurate, and deterministic in its response, while increasing the temperature to a maximum value of <strong>1</strong> will result in more diverse and risky completions.</li>
        </ul>
