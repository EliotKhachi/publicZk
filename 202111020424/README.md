# I2C Communication

## Overview
I2C is a [Serial Communication](../202111021920) protocol that involves two wires:  
1. SDA (data)  
2. SCL (clock)  

Each device has an SDA and SCL wire, and all devices are connected to the same SDA and SCL buses.   

The SDA and SCL wires work together to define the *start* and *stop* conditions, and the bits of data in between.
