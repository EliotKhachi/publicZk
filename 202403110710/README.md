# RDS Read Replicas

RDS read replicas are used to scale your application's capabilities to read from your RDS database.  

## Features
You can create up to 15 read replicas in your cluster, within an AZ, across AZs, and even across regions!!! Make sure to update your application's connection to them.  
Read replicas replicate the write instance asyncronously (eventually consistent)  
Read replicas can be promoted to their own DB
