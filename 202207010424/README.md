# What is SSH?

SSH stands for *secure shell*. It is a protocol for communication between two machines (the client-server model) through a secure channel.  

## Three Layers
1. Transport Layer - Ensure secure communication between server and client. Monitors data encryption/decrption and the integrity of the connection.  
2. Authentication Layer - Authenticates client trying to access the server  
3. Connection Layer - Manages communication channels after authentication
