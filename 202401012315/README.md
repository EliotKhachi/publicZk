# Future of Systems Engineering Notes - Nov. 29th, 2023

William (Bill) Miller, INCODE FuSE Lead - Definition of systems engineering (SE):
1. A determination for the objective to be reached.  
2. A thorough consideration of all factors that bear upon the possiblity of reaching that objective and the relationships among those factors.  

One could say that the purpose of the SE process is to find the optimal solution to a problem. But this is nearly impossible. We cannot automate this completely while arriving at an *objectively* optimal solution. Assumptions must be made in the face of unknowns/uncertainties and the stakeholders' needs and requirements must be carefully prioritized. Perfect models and simulations and hardcore calculated processes don't exist.  

The major problem industry faces is having a single source of truth that instantenously responds to change and communicates change. The reason we don't have this currently is simply be

Modeling the people that interact with the system is just as important as the hardware/software components of the system. The people direct the trajectory of system design. People are influenced/controlled through policies. A great analogy here are IAM policies to control user permissions in relation to AWS resources.   

The Lifecycle Modeling Language is another modeling language aside from SysML v2, used by [SPEC Innovations](https://specinnovations.com/).
