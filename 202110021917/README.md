# Four Benefits of Developing a Reference Architecture

## Definition
A Reference Architecture is a high fidelity representation used to develop a technology. Regardless of the exact technology or purpose thereof, a reference architecture is abstracted from the common requirements, physical architectures, and functions of related technologies.

## Benefits
1. Common language within organization eliminates the plague of vague and reduces the likelyhood of miscommunication.
2. Accelerated the time to market of a new problem b/c the high fidelity representation gave them a starting point.
3. Found more commonality in their product line or in their family of systems
4. Generated a built-in learning system: they now had the ability to compare new, completed systems against the reference architecture to update that architecture and better prepare for the next new, related problem.
