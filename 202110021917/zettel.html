        <h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
        <p>A Reference Architecture is a high fidelity representation used to develop a technology. Regardless of the exact technology or purpose thereof, a reference architecture is abstracted from the common requirements, physical architectures, and functions of related technologies.</p>
        <h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Common language within organization, eliminated the plague of vague, and mis-communication</li>
        <li>Accelerated the time to market of a new problem b/c the high fidelity representation gave them a starting point.</li>
        <li>Found more commonality in their product line or in their family of systems</li>
        <li>Generated a built-in learning system: they now had the ability to compare new, completed systems against the reference architecture to update that architecture and better prepare for the next new, related problem.</li>
