# AWS CloudFormation

AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources using *templates* so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS.  

## Example Templates 
* For a scalable web application that also includes a backend database, you might use an Auto Scaling group, an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, and an Amazon Relational Database Service database instance. With a CloudFormation template, CloudFormation provisions the Auto Scaling group, load balancer, and database for you.  

* If your application requires additional availability, you might replicate it in multiple regions so that if one region becomes unavailable, your users can still use your application in other regions. Create a CloudFormation template and reuse it in each Region to create your resources in a consistent and repeatable manner.
