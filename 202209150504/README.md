# Spring DI 

Spring *DI*, or *Dependency Injection*, is a foundational technology for spring web development and database management. Once you understand how to implement DIs, learning web, database, and security development will be easy!

## Why Learn Spring
**Flexible Applications** - As opposed to standard Java DI, Spring DI is resolved at run-time, not compile-time, which makes our applications configurable after being compiled. Meaning, we can further configure our application per user or environment *after* it has been tested and packaged.

**Foundational** - Spring DI is foundational for Spring web development and database management. Once the patterns are learned, learning web, database, and security development will be easier.
