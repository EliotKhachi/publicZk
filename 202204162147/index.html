<p>Welding is a process used to join metals at the molecular level, forming a homogenous bond between two or more pieces of metal.</p>

<p><strong>Four Components</strong> 1. The Metals to be Joined<br />
2. Heat Source<br />
3. Filler Metal<br />
4. “Air Shield”</p>
<p>To make a weld, first you place the parent metals in near proximity <a href="https://welditu.com/welding/tips/welding-joints-welds/">Guide to Welding Joint Types</a> and, depending on the circumstance, hold them securely in place. Next, you heat the space in between them to their melting points while shielding the heated area from the air. Finally, you add the filler metal to join the parent metals and create a single piece of metal. There are different techniques to achieve this, see <a href="https://www.cruxweld.com/blog/types-of-welding-processes/">12 Different Types of Welding Processes - Grux Weld</a>.</p>
