# Introduction to Tree Data Structure 

A *Tree*, a *non-linear* data structure, consists of a collection of nodes where each node stores a value, has a parent node (except the root node), and has children node(s). It's used to effectively store and retrieve data.  

## Properties
* Popular tree traversal algorithms include *Breadth First Search* and *Depth First Search*.   
* Has no loop and no circuit
* Has no self-loop
* Hierarchical
