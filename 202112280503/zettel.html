        <ul>
        <li>Also considered the first rule of GD&amp;T or rule 1 of GD&amp;T, <em>perfect form at MMC</em> requires the forms of features to be perfect at the maximum material condition.</li>
        <li>This rule applies to your drawing if GD&amp;T is invoked anywhere in the print.</li>
        <li>This ensures that mating components fit without specifiying a tolerance for deviation in form.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>For Example:</strong> If a pin and hole at maximum material condition fit at 1/2" diameter with exactly 0 clearance left, then <em>any</em> deviation in form of the pin <em>or</em> the hole will prevent proper mating. Thankfully, the first rule of GD&amp;T makes implicit to the drawing interpreter/machinist that there must be perfect form at MMC; therefore, in this case, the machinist must produce the features closer to LMC in order to achieve some clearance.</p>
