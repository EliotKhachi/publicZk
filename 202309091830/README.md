# AqualinkD Project

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to to control the pool and spa features from your phone, wherever you are. Imagine you have a long day at work... and you want to get the jacuzzi nice and steamy by the time you get home :).

## Hardware
I am connecting a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/) to my pool's contrrol panel. There are 4 wires that run from the control panel to the Raspberry Pi.
