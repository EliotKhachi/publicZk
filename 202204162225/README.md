# MIG Welding

MIG welding is one of the most simple and popular methods of welding.  

It involves a welding *gun* that has two concentric nozzles. The inner nozzle, *feeds* the filler metal in the form of a wire to the base metal. The outer nozzle *expels* shielding gas, such as Argon, around the feed wire. The tip of the wire also acts as electrode to create the arc with the base metal, thereby generating heat to melt the base metal and adding the filler metal.

MIG welding is sensitive to external factors like rain, wind, and dust. MIG welding could also create bad quality welds due to dross and porosity.
