# Living in Congruence With One's Self

To live in congruence with one's self means your actions are in accordance with your beliefs. It means your body, mind, and spirit are in sync. They are in harmony and *you* are the symphony.  

Actions arise out of beliefs. If your actions cannot be reconciled with your beliefs, then you are not being congruent. Either your governing principle or your behavior needs to be corrected to achieve harmony.
