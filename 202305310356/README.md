# Filter Voltage Fluctuations at Power Terminals of Microcontroller

Noise gets introduced into circuits all sorts of ways. This is not good because they can cause [Floating pins  ](../202110192017/README.md). One place they occur is between the positive and negative terminals of your microcontroller.

To filter out the voltage noise to GND, place a small capacitor in your circuit between these terminals.   

This is called a *bypass* or *decoupling* capacitor. [Capacitors ](../202305080332/README.md)
