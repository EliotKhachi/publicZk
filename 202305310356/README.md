# Filter Voltage Fluctuations at Power Terminals of Microcontroller

Noise gets introduced into circuits all sorts of ways. One place is between the positive and negative terminals of your microcontroller. Place a small capacitor in your circuit between these terminals to filter out any unwanted voltage noise to GND.  

This is called a *bypass* or *decoupling* capacitor. [Capacitors ](../202305080332/README.md)
