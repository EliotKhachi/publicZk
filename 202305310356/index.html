<p>Noise gets introduced into circuits all sorts of ways. This is not good because they can cause <a href="../202110192017/README.md">Floating pins</a>. One place they occur is between the positive and negative terminals of your microcontroller.</p>
<p>To filter out the voltage noise to GND, place a small capacitor in your circuit between these terminals.</p>
<p>This is called a <em>bypass</em> or <em>decoupling</em> capacitor. <a href="../202305080332/README.md">Capacitors</a></p>
