# Sensors

*Sensors* are electronic devices used to measure the value of a property in the physical world.  

They do this by outputting an analog signal. The voltage of that signal maps to a value for a unit of measurement. See the sensor's datasheet for answers to the following questions?   
1. How is the voltage mapped?  
2. What range of voltages does the mapping hold true for?  
3. What is the accuracy of the sensor?  

## Types
* Temperature  
* Light  
* Sound  
* Pressure  
* Angular Momentum  
* Gravity  
* Acceleration  

## Example
Pressure sensor
Operational range: 0 - 200 psi  
Voltage Mapping: X psi = (voltage reading - 1.3 V)*54.05; i.e. 3.5 V = 118.9 psi
Range: 0 - 200 psi or 1.3 - 5 volts
Accuracy: +/- 10 psi
