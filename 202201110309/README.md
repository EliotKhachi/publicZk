# Liquid Rocket Engine (LRE) Systems Design Integration 

In addition to the basic principles of systems engineering [\[What is Systems Engineering? \]](../202201080221), there are several considerations pertaining to LRE systems that a rocket systems engineer must  keep in mind while performing engine systems design integration type of work:  

1. [\[System Dynamic Analysis\]](../202202182135)  
2. [\[System Calibration\]](../202202182136)  
3. [\[System Integration Performance Characteristics\]](../202204180449)  
4. [\[Mechanical Integration\]](../202204180448)  
5. [\[Clustering of Engines\]](../202204180448) 
6. [\[Vehicle Interface\]](../202204180446)
