# Rocket Engine System Integration: Calibration

Due to unavoidable mechanical tolerances, there is always calibration required during system integration to meet expected rocket engine operating characteristics.

* First, the pressure-drop vs flow-rate characteristics of each component in the propellant-feed system must be tested and recorded. The summation of these pressure-drops yield the characteristic propellant-flow curve of an engine system.

* The design orifice pressure drop should be equal to the square root of the sum of squares of the maximum pressure drops of each component.
