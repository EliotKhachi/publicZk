# Liquid Rocket Engine (LRE) Systems Design Integration

In addition to the basic principles of systems engineering [\[What is Systems Engineering? \]](../202201080221), there are several considerations pertaining to LRE systems that a rocket systems engineer must  keep in mind while performing engine systems design integration type of work:  

1. [\[System Dynamic Analysis\]](../202202182135)  
2. [\[System Calibration\]](../202202182136)  
3. [\[System Integration Performance Characteristics\]](../202202182138)  
4. [\[Mechanical Integration\]](../202202182141)  
5. [\[Clustering of Engines\]](../202202182147)
