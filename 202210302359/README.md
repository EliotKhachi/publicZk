# The Evolution of Professional Technology Infrastructure 

1. Large organizations housed at least one very large and expensive computer, the *mainframe*.

2.  As desktop computing surged, one mainframe was replaced by several less expensive, but capable servers.  

3. As networks improved, organizations didn't have the resources or the interest in maintaining their servers. Server management became outsourced. 

**The IT profession was born.** 

**Up until this point, computing resources suffered from the Goldilocks Syndrome: The computing power available on demand was either too much or not enough**   

4. Computer professionals then figured out how to virtualize servers. One physical machine can now run multiple, isolated instances of an operating system.

**The cloud was born. Computing resources could now be managed more effectively by booting up virtual machines on demand.**  

5. Computer professionals realized that a lot of computer resources were being used just to run the operating systems of the virtual machines. They figured out how to virtualize isolated computing environments called **containers** that share the operating system of the physical machine.
