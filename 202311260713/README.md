# Building a quality USB-C microphone

The basic idea here is to use the same microphone capsule found in high-end microphones and build our own circuitry around it to transfer the signal to a computer through a USB-C port.  

The signal directly from the microphone capsule is too weak so we need to amplify it. This involves a transistor.   

## Materials
1. JLI 2555 microphone capsule  
2. 

## Steps
1. Solder transistor gate to microphone + (capsule's central tab)
