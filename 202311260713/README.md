# Building a quality USB-C microphone

The basic idea here is to use the same microphone capsule found in high-end microphones and build our own circuitry around it to transfer the signal to a computer through a USB-C port.  

The signal directly from the microphone capsule is too weak so we need to amplify it. This involves a transistor.   

## Materials
1. JLI 2555 microphone capsule  
2. Desoldering wire  
3. Enameled copper wire (taken out of a small electric motor)  
4. Heat shrink wrap  
5. Audio cable  

## Tools
1. Heat gun
2. Voltmeter
3. 

## Steps
1. Solder transistor gate to microphone + (capsule's central tab)  
2. Create vibration isolating signal (VIS) wire
    * Open the desoldering wire into a tube
    * Route two strands of enameled copper wire through the desoldering wire
3. Connect transistor drain and source pins to VIS wire  
4. Use brass wire mesh to create
