# How to Estimate Project Costs (Roughly)

To create a project estimate, do the following:  
1. Define your project scope  
2. Create a schedule, defining milestones and tasks  
3. Estimating the time and resources it takes to perform each task.  
4. Identify the type of costs for each task [[Types of Project Costs](../202312060351)]  
5. Include any costs you might have missed, i.e. [Indirect Costs](../202312060353)
