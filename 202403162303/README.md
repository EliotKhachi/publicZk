# RDS Proxy

A fully managed database proxy for RDS. By using Amazon RDS Proxy, you can allow your applications to pool and share database connections to improve their ability to scale.  

## Why use an RDS Proxy?
* Improve resiliency to database failures.  
* Handle unpredictable database traffic.  
* Enforce [IAM authentication](../202309150127) and securely store credentials in [Secrets Manager](../202403162309)  
* Never publicly accessible (must be accessed from VPC)
