        <p>The <em>scarcity mindset</em> is in direct opposition to the <a href="../202308040125/README.md">The Abundance Mindset</a>. It is a competitive frame of viewing the world wherein there isn't enough for everyone. This mindset is associated with being in a state of fear. You view the people around you as opponents.</p>
        <h2 id="material-scarcity">Material Scarcity</h2>
        <p>The world is a zero-sum game. The fulfillment of your desires and needs is at the expense of other people. You're in constant fight or flight mode. You compete against others to get what you want or flee to protect what you have.</p>
