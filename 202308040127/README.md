# The Scarcity Mindset

The *scarcity mindset* is in direct opposition to the [The Abundance Mindset](../202308040125/README.md). It is a competitive frame of viewing the world wherein there isn't enough to meet everyone's wants and needs. The fulfillment of your wants and needs is contingent on other people.  

This mindset is associated with being in a state of fear because you view the people around you as opponents you must conquer or surrender to. It's anxiety provoking. You're in constant fight or flight mode.  
**Fight** - You must compete, fight, and win against others to fulfill your desires.  
**Flight** - You must surrender or flee to protect what you have.
