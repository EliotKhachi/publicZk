# The Scarcity Mindset
The *scarcity mindset* is in direct opposition to the [The Abundance Mindset](../202308040125/README.md).  

## Material Scarcity
It is a competitive frame of viewing the world wherein there isn't enough to meet everyone's desires and needs. The fulfillment of your desires and needs is at the expense of other people.  
This mindset is associated with being in a state of fear because you view the people around you as opponents. You're in constant fight or flight mode. You must either compete against others to get what you want or flee to protect what you have.
