        <p>In an increasingly complex world, the need for a systematic approach to solving complex problems is increasing. Here are some examples of technological advancements/endeavours that are introducing more and more complexity.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Advent of artifical intelligence (AI) and AI systems</li>
        <li>Robotics</li>
        <li>Space flight</li>
        <li>Software and Data Management</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of the above technologies were very limited a few decades ago and have only recently been thoroughly developed. Systems engineering as a technology was born out of necessity from aerospace and defense system development, but it can be applied to a variety of existing, old disciplines:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Automobile/Mechanical Systems</li>
        <li>Electric Circuit Design</li>
        <li>Medicine</li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <p>In addition to aiding technological development, systems engineering facilitates business growth and execution by linking the needs of the stakeholders and customers to the product design.</p>
