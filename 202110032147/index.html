<p>In an increasingly complex world, the need for a systematic approach to solving complex problems is increasing. Here are some examples of technological advancements/endeavours that are introducing more and more complexity. * Advent of artifical intelligence (AI) and AI systems * Robotics * Space flight * Software and Data Management</p>
<p>All of the above technologies were very limited a few decades ago and have only recently been thoroughly developed. Systems engineering as a technology was born out of necessity from aerospace and defense system development, but it can be applied to a variety of existing, old disciplines: * Automobile/Mechanical Systems * Electric Circuit Design * Medicine â€” In addition to aiding technological development, systems engineering facilitates business growth and execution by linking the needs of the stakeholders and customers to the product design.</p>
