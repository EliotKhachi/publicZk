# Why Systems Engineering is Becoming More Important

In an increasingly complex world, the need for a systematic approach to solving complex problems is increasing. Here are some examples of technological advancements/endeavours that are introducing more and more complexity.
* Advent of artifical intelligence (AI) and AI systems
* Robotics
* Space flight
* Software and Data Management

All of the above technologies were very limited a few decades ago and have only recently been thoroughly developed. Systems engineering as a technology was born out of necessity from aerospace and defense system development, but it can be applied to a variety of existing, old disciplines:
* Automobile/Mechanical Systems
* Electric Circuit Design
* Medicine

In addition to aiding technological development, systems engineering facilitates business growth and execution by linking the needs of the stakeholders and customers to the product design.
