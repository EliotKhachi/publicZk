<h1 id="how-much-resistance">How Much Resistance?</h1>
<p>How much resistance (R) do we have to put into a circuit so that our components will work and won’t break?</p>
<p>To answer this question, use <a href="../202305080119">Ohm’s Law</a>: V = IR and the principles of <a href="../202305080141">Series and Parallel</a> circuits.</p>
<h2 id="things-to-find-out-first">Things to Find Out First</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Draw out your circuit. Identify what is in parallel and series <em>with what</em> (these are relative terms).<br />
</li>
<li>What is the Voltage (V) of your power source?<br />
</li>
<li>What component are you trying to power?
<ul>
<li>What is the <em>forward voltage</em> (VF) of your component?</li>
<li>How many amps (A) does your component use?</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Consider a simple series circuit with a battery, resistory, and LED:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>LED</li>
<li>9V</li>
<li>3.2V (look up the manufacturer’s datasheet)</li>
<li>24 mA / 0.024 A (look up the manufacturer’s datasheet)</li>
</ol>
<p>R = (9 - 3.2) / 0.024 = 240 Ohms</p>
