# How Much Resistance?

How much resistance (R) do we have to put into a circuit so that our components will work and won't break?  

**The Formula**: R = (V - VF) / A

## Things to Find Out First
1. What is the Voltage (V) of your power source?  
2. What component are you trying to power?  
    * What is the *forward voltage* (VF) of your component?
    * How many amps (A) does your component use?  

## Example
1. LED
2. 9V
3. 3.2V (look up the manufacturer's datasheet)
4. 24 mA / 0.024 A (look up the manufacturer's datasheet)

R = (9 - 3.2) / 0.024 = 240 Ohms
