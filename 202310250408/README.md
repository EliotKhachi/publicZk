# Server Name Indication (SNI)

Server Name Indication is a newer protocol of the SSL/TLS handshake where the hostname is also part of the handshake. Servers can now have multiple SSL/TLS certificates that each correspond with different domains/websites.  TLS handshakes are made with the appropriate website based on the hostname that the client indicated.
