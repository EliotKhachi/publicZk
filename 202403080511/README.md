# Key Properties of State Machines

**Determinism** - When a state machine is determinant, that means that each state has only one transition available to it at all points in time. A non-determinant state machine results in ambiguous behavior.  
**Reachability** - When a state machine is reachable, that means that every state can be reachedthrough at least one sequence of transitions beginning from the initial state. If any stateis unreachable then the state machine is flawed or that state can be ommitted.  
**Dead-lock** - When a state machine reaches dead-lock, that means that it is stuck in a state. More specifically, there are 0 transitions available in that state.  
**Stability** - A stable state machine is one wherein the amount of time the state machine lingers in any particular state is pre-defined and expected; it can even be indefinite, if it is waiting for an input, for example. So long as it is defined and measurable or observable.
