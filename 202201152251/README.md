# Flow Variables 

|Variable|Definition|Symbol or Equation|
|-|-|  
|Velocity|The speed of the fluid. This variable can refer to the average (bulk) velocity of a fluid flow or a velocity function such as the profile of fluid velocity against a wall (fluid particle's speed increases with the distance from that wall).|*v*|  

|Mach|The velocity of the fluid divided by the speed of sound|*M*|
|Density|The mass per unit volume of a fluid|*rho*|
|Static Pressure|The force per unit area exerted by a fluid|*p*|  
|Dynamic Pressure|The kinetic energy of a fluid|*rho* * *v^2* / 2|
|Gas Constant|Thermodynamic property based on the chemical composition of the fluid|*R*|
