# Subnets

A subnet is short for *subnetwork*, which is a network inside of a network. Subnetting allows logical groupings of networks to better route traffic through a network.  

In more concrete terms, a subnet is defined as a range of IP addresses within the larger network.  

## Example
For example, take the IP address 203.0.113.112.  

`203` is the Class A network. This could have a range of 203.0.0.0 - 203.255.255.255 
`203.0` is the Class B network.  
`203.0.113` is the Class C network.  
`203.0.113.112` is the device.
