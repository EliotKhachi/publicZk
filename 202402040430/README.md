# The Waterfall Model 

The Waterfall Model is a method of project management for developing complex systems. Pure waterfall models are project phases in a linear and sequential fashion.  
1. Requirement Definition   
2. Analysis  
3. Design  
4. Prototype/Build/Integrate   
5. Test 
6. Production  
7. Operations, maintenance  
8. Disposal  

**Pros**
* An organized, logical, easy-to-understand approach  
* Time spent in the early phases help *prevent* mistakes and cost overruns in later phases  
**Cons**
* Customers may not exactly know what their requirements are   
* Designers may not be aware of all the limitations or future difficulties. In practice, testing and redesigning is inevitable and should be prepared for  
* It's difficult to separate design and analysis processes
