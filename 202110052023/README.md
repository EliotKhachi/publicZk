# What is Model-Based Systems Engineering? 

## What
Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is an approach to systems engineering [[What is Systems Engineering?](../202201080221)] that is *model-based* as opposed to *document-based*.  

## The Problem
The problem with the document-based approach is that any change to the left side of the [The Vee Model ](../202110032218) must be updated across many documents manually. Furthermore, the impact of a change on the rest of the system requires thoughtful investigation, and could potentially result in design changes elsewhere.  

## The Solution
On the other hand, a model-based approach propagates changes automatically. Additionally, the model serves as a *single source of truth* and data is an authoritative source of truth, thereby streamlining communication.  

## Leaving Note
MBSE supports quick iteration and delivers return-on-investment when change happens.
