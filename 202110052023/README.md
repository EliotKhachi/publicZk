# What is Model-Based Systems Engineering? 

## Philosophy
Model-Based Systems Engineering is an approach to systems engineering [[What is Systems Engineering?](../202201080221)] that is *model-based* as opposed to *document-based*.  

Rather than having hundreds (if not thousands) of documents spread throughout the organization that outline your requirements, system architecture, design, analysis, etc., you maintain a single model. The advantage here is that any changes, revisions, or updates are made directly to the model once rather than to hundreds of documents. Any change propogates throughout the model. That model has authority over information exchange. What is in the model reigns supreme. 

MBSE delivers ROI when change happens.
