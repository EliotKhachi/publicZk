# LRE Combustion Cycles 

What makes a liquid rocket engine an *engine*, is the fact that it is self-sufficient. Engines generate their own power to drive more fuel through itself. The *combustion cycle* of a liquid rocket engine is simply the method by which it is powering itself. Keep in mind, however, that in all cases what is being powered is the [turbopump(s)](/202201100451).

| |Combustion Cycle|Description|Open or Closed Cycle?|Performance Rating (1-5)|  
|-|-|-|-|  
|1|Gas Generator|The exhaust from a *preburner* is channeled into the *turbopump* and then dumped overboard, providing boost. It can also be channeled into the *main combustion chamber* for cooling purposes (as well as boost).|Open|2|  
|2|Staged|Hot, partially-combusted gas from the *preburner(s)* is fed into the *turbopump* and then into the *main combustion chamber*, where it completes combustion with its counter-part, liquid propellant. The *preburners* exhaust either *fuel-rich* or *oxidizer-rich* hot gases. Usually preburners run fuel-rich because flame temperatures are lower and more manageable; however, if RP-1 fuel is used with this combustion cycle, then the *preburner* will likely run *oxidizer-rich* because running *fuel-rich* can cause soot (carbon deposits) to clog up the turbopump and/or main injector.|Closed|3|  
|3|Full Flow|Similar to Staged combustion: Hot, fuel-rich gas from the fuel preburner and hot, oxidizer-rich gas from the oxidizer preburner are fed through their respective turbopumps and into the main combustion chamber, where they meet for glorious combustion.|Closed|5|
