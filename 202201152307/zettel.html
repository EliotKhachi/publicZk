        <p>What makes a liquid rocket engine an <em>engine</em>, is the fact that it is self-sufficient. Engines generate their own power to drive more fuel through itself. The <em>combustion cycle</em> of a liquid rocket engine is simply the method by which it is powering itself. Keep in mind, however, that in all cases what is being powered is the <a href="/202201100451">turbopump(s)</a>.</p>

        |1|Gas Generator|The exhaust from a <em>preburner</em> is channeled into the <em>turbopump</em> and then dumped overboard, providing boost. It can also be channeled into the <em>main combustion chamber</em> for cooling purposes (as well as boost).|Open|2|<br />
        |2|Staged|Hot, partially-combusted gas from the <em>preburner(s)</em> is fed into the <em>turbopump</em> and then into the <em>main combustion chamber</em>, where it completes combustion with its counter-part, liquid propellant. The <em>preburners</em> exhaust either <em>fuel-rich</em> or <em>oxidizer-rich</em> hot gases. Usually preburners run fuel-rich because flame temperatures are lower and more manageable; however, if RP-1 fuel is used with this combustion cycle, then the <em>preburner</em> will likely run <em>oxidizer-rich</em> because running <em>fuel-rich</em> can cause soot (carbon deposits) to clog up the turbopump and/or main injector.|Closed|3|<br />
        |3|Full Flow|Similar to Staged combustion: Hot, fuel-rich gas from the fuel preburner and hot, oxidizer-rich gas from the oxidizer preburner are fed through their respective turbopumps and into the main combustion chamber, where they meet for glorious combustion.|Closed|5|</p>
