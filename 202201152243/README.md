# Entropy  

* Associated with a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty  
* A numerical value that shows that many physical processes can only go in one direction in time.  
* The 2nd law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of  isolated systems cannot decrease over time; they always approach *thermodynamics equilibrium*, a state of maximum entropy.
