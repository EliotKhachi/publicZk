# How to Supercharge Your Life Goals

To supercharge your life goals, you need to define your motivations for them. What is pulling you towards them and what are you running away from? 

First, write down your goals. Then, for each of your goals, write down the benefits you would get or desires you would fulfill if you accomplished that goal. Breakup your desires into 3 categories: Desires of your higher-self, day-to-day self, and lower-self.  

For each desire, flesh out what it would do for you if you fulfilled it, how it would make you feel, and how that would put you in an upward spiral/trajectory in life.  
Also for each desire, flesh out what you would be missing out on if you didn't fulfill it, how it would make you feel, and how that would put you in a downward spiral/trajectory in life. Consider feedback loops, what your mental state would look like, and your overall demeanor.
