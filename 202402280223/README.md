# How to Supercharge Your Motivation For Your Goals

To superchage your motivations for a goal you need to write them down.  

Break up your motivations as stemming from 3 different parts of your self: your higher-self, day-to-day self, and lower-self [[Types of Motivations](../202402280215)].  

Flesh out what achieving this goal would do for you, who you would become, how you would feel, and how that would put you in an upward spiral/trajectory in life.  

Next, flesh out what pain or suffering you are avoiding, what you would do and who you would become if you couldn't avoid them, how that would make you feel, and how that would put you in a downward spiral/trajectory in life.  

Consider how your mental state, demeanor, and outlook on life would change, and the feedback loops therein.
