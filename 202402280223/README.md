# How to Supercharge Your Motivation For Your Goals

To superchage your motivations for a goal you need to write them down.  

For each goal, break up your motivations for that goal into 3 different parts: higher-self, day-to-day self, and lower-self motivations [[Types of Motivations](../202402280215)].  

For each motivation, ask yourself:  
* What would achieving this goal would do for you?
* How would you feel?
* How that would put you in an upward spiral/trajectory in life?

* What pain or suffering you are avoiding by achieving this goal?
* How would you feel if you couldn't avoid those things?
* How that would put you in a downward spiral/trajectory in life.

Consider how your mental state, demeanor, and outlook on life would change, and the feedback loops therein.
