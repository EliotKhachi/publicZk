<h1 id="model-view-controller">Model View Controller</h1>
<p>The <strong>Model-view-controller (MVC)</strong> is a software architectural pattern commonly used for developing web, desktop, mobile, and console-based applications.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The MVC separates application concerns predictably to enforce maintainability and scalability.</p></li>
<li><p>The MVC is all about who can talk to whom.</p></li>
<li><p>The MVC divides program logic into three interconncted components:</p></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Model [Domain Layer] - A class that represents domain data.</p></li>
<li><p>View [User Interface Layer] - Concerned with presenting data to the user and accepting input from the user.</p></li>
<li><p>Controller [User Interface Layer] - Mediates between the view and the model. It is an implementation of the <em>inversion of control</em> principle <a href="../202210100408">202210100408</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The <em>service</em> <a href="../202210100444">202210100444</a> handles the model. The controller executes methods in the view and service to coordinate between them. The view doesnâ€™t know about the controller or the service. All components know about the model.</p>
