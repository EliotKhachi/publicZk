# Amazon EBS

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes are network drives that attach (mount) to one EC2 instance at a time. EBS volumes must be in the same [Availability Zone](../202309120416) as your instance.  

We recommend Amazon EBS for data that must be quickly accessible and requires long-term persistence.  

if you want very fast data read and write, see [Amazon EC2 Instance Store](../202309120447).
