# Amazon EBS

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices, except they are attached via a network. You can mount these volumes as devices on your instances. EBS volumes must be in the same [Availability Zone](https://github.com/EliotKhachi//publicZk/tree/main/202309120416)as your instance.  

We recommend Amazon EBS for data that must be quickly accessible and requires long-term persistence.  

To copy, , and archive EBS volumes, see [EBS Snapshots](https://github.com/EliotKhachi//publicZk/tree/main/202309150357).  

If you want very fast accessibility, see [Amazon EC2 Instance Store](https://github.com/EliotKhachi//publicZk/tree/main/202309120447).
