# Reserved EC2 Instances

*Reserved* EC2 instances have upto a 72% discount compared to [On-Demand](https://github.com/EliotKhachi//publicZk/tree/main/202309150316). You reserve specific instance attributes like instance type, region, tenancy, and OS, and you must specify a reservation period (i.e. 1 year). Recommended for steady-state, long-term usage applications.  

*Convertible Reserved Instances* allow you to be flexible with instance type, family, OS, scope, and tenancy.
