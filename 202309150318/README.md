# Spot EC2 Instances

*Spot* EC2 instances can get a discount of up to 90% compared to [On-Demand](https://github.com/EliotKhachi//publicZk/tree/main/202309150316).  

They are instances you can *lose* at any point if you max price is less than the current spot price. It is the *MOST* cost-efficient instance in AWS.  

Recommended for workloads that are resilient to failure.
