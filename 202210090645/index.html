<h1 id="models-in-a-software-application">Models in a Software Application</h1>
<p>All software application layers point to <strong>Models</strong>. Models are not layers themselves. They represent domain <em>data</em>, but not <em>behavior</em>, and they don’t enforce any rules for any of the layers. Rather, models represent a sort of shared vocabulary between layers to promote information flow. The user interface layer can’t do its job without knowing a bit about the domain. The same goes for the data access layer.</p>
