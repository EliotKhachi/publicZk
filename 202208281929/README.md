# Back-End Development

The back-end of your application includes a primary database, server-side run time, and a web server.

## Mandatory Technologies
**Primary database**
*NoSQL document databases:* Flexible, cheap, fast, but not good at defining relationships.
Relational database: MySQL, PostGres, not as flexible, more overhead costs
*Graph databases:* neo4j
**Server-side Runtime**
*What language are you most comfortable with?*
*Python:* Flask, django
*Ruby:* Rails
*PHP:* Larvel
*Spring:* Java
*JavaScript:* nodeJS (runtime), nestJS (server-side stuff)
**Web Server**
Nginx, Apache

## Optional Technologies
**Secondary database**
Redis --> Caching layer that stores data on memory instead of disk. Used to speed up primary database
**Object Relational Mapper**
Helps write to your database instead of doing it manually, i.e. SQL queries.
