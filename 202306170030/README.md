# Voltage Regulators

A voltage regulator is used to get an output voltage that is lower than the input voltage.  

## Why Not Just Use a Resistor?
While it is true that a resistor can be placed in series to draw out some voltage from your power source, it is far from an optimal solution.  
1. Resistors dissipate heat, making your circuit power inefficient.  
2. You will experience voltage fluctuations. The voltage drop across the resistor depends on the current running through it, which depends on the load in your circuit. If the load in your circuit changes, so will the voltage.  
3. You will gradually experience a voltage drop throughout your circuit. As you use up your battery, *its* supply voltage will drop. Consequently, the voltage aft the resistor to the rest of your circuit will drop.
