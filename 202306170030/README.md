# Voltage Regulators

A voltage regulator is used to get steady output voltage that is lower than the input voltage. This allows you to use small, power-inexpensive components in your circuit while using a relatively large battery.  

## Why Not Just Use a Resistor?
While it is true that a resistor can be placed in series to draw out some voltage from your power source, it is far from an optimal solution. [3 Reasons to use a voltage regulator instead of a resistor](../202306170037/README.md)
