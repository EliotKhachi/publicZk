# How Can I Use SysML? When Will I Use it?

* You can use SysML as a notation set to keep all 9 diagrams consistent with each other and so everyone can agree on what certain things mean. These diagrams capture the various aspects of systems engineering ([202110032218](../202110032218) - The Vee Model).

* SysML should be gradually incorporated into the product development process ([202110032326](../202110032326) - Steps to Implementing a Model-Based Enterprise.)
