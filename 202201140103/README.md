# Engine Weight Considerations 

## Terms
**Dry Weight** - Net weight of the engine as it leaves the factory.

**Burnout Weight** - Engine dry weight plus residual, measurable propellants remaining in the engine at cutoff. Typically 4% more than dry weight.

**Wet Weight** - Dry weight plus all propellant in it during main stage. May be 6% higher than dry weight. This factor significantly affects CG of rocket and moments of inertia.

**Wet Gimballed Weight** - The *portion* of wet weight that represents the engine mass that is gimballed for steering.


The *propellant fraction* is a parameter used to guide the design of a rocket, particularly while neglecting the influence of vehicle structural weight.
It is defined as the ratio of the total propellant weight to the fueled vehicle weight without payload.

Mathematically:
PF = mp/(mp + ms)
, where PF is the propellant fraction, mp is the total propellant mass, and ms is the total structural mass of the rocket.
