        <p><strong>Dry Weight</strong> - Net weight of the engine as it leaves the factory.</p>
        <p><strong>Burnout Weight</strong> - Engine dry weight plus residual, measurable propellants remaining in the engine at cutoff. Typically 4% more than dry weight.</p>
        <p><strong>Wet Weight</strong> - Dry weight plus all propellant in it during main stage. May be 6% higher than dry weight. This factor significantly affects CG of rocket and moments of inertia.</p>
        <p><strong>Wet Gimballed Weight</strong> - The <em>portion</em> of wet weight that represents the engine mass that is gimballed for steering.</p>
        <p>The <em>propellant fraction</em> is a parameter used to guide the design of a rocket, particularly while neglecting the influence of vehicle structural weight. It is defined as the ratio of the total propellant weight to the fueled vehicle weight without payload.</p>
        <p>Mathematically: PF = mp/(mp + ms) , where PF is the propellant fraction, mp is the total propellant mass, and ms is the total structural mass of the rocket.</p>
