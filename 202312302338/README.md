# MBSE - Why At All and Why Now?

* MBSE adoption is being encouraged by INCOSE, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the National Astronautics and Space Administration (NASA).  
* In addition to the aerospace industry, the automotive and medical industries are also beginning to adopt it.  
* NASA has a vision for MBSE adoption within their organization by 2029. [Future MBSE Vision and Strategy Bridge for NASA](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20210014025/downloads/TM-20210014025.pdf)  
* The Object Management Group (OMG) published a beta specification for version 2 of their Systems Modeling Language, SysMLv2, in June 2023 [[What is SysML?](../202110032315)], leading to a final adopted SysML v2 specification in 2024.  
* The specification includes an open-source REST API and builds upon the expressiveness and versatility of SysML v1.  
* SysmL v2 introduces for the first time a standardized *textual notation* for modeling systems, which makes it easier to build software around it.
