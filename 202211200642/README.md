# Safety Netting

The first step to learning something new is to take a step back and create a *safety net* for yourself.  

A safety net is the logical backbone you can fall back on whenever you get lost. 

To create a safety net, ask yourself:

* What are we talking about? 
* Why is this important?  
* How is this important?  
* What can I do when I learn this?  
* What can't I do even though I've learned this?  
* Where can I find further knowledge?  
* Who are the experts?
