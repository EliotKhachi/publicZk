# Safety Netting

Before learning something new, create a *safety net* for yourself.  

A safety net is a collection of knowledge you are already familiar with
 that is related to the new topic you're trying to learn. It also 
defines resources you can use, what capabilities are unlocked after 
having learned this, and it ties in your emotions and motivations.  

To create a safety net, ask yourself:

* What are we talking about? 
* Why is this important?  
* How is this important?  
* What can I do when I learn this?  
* What can't I do even though I've learned this?  
* Where can I find further knowledge?  
* Who are the experts?
