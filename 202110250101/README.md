# Quality Control Inspections 

Quality control inspections are regulated services that verify product or process standards (the right part/assembly/process at the right place at the right time)

## Types Related to Quantity and Shipment
1. **Sample Checking** - Performed for a small # of items from a bigger batch.
2. **Pre-Production Inspections (PPI)** - Assesses quality and quantity of raw materials and components prior to production.
3. **During Production Inspection (DPI)** - Done for products in continuous production that must adhere to strict, timely requirements. Performed early, generally when 10-15% of the intended batch is completed.
4. **Pre-Shipment Inspection (PSI)** - Performed when ~80% of products are packed.
5. **Piece by Piece Inspection (or Sorting Inspection)** - 100% of goods are inspected, before or after packaging.
6. **Loading and unloading supervision** - Ensure product information and quantity, packaging compliance, shipper container condition, and loading and unloading processes all meet pre-determined standards.

## Specific Tests and Technologies
1. **Metal Detection** - Crucial for products not intending to contain metal
2. **Visual Inspection** - Detecting suface flaws (corrosion, contamination, surface finish, discontinuities on joints: welds, seals, solder connections)
3. **Coordinate measuring machines (CMM)** - Inspects dimensions with probes and arms
4. **Machine Vision** - Can be used for various things to improve accuracy and reduce costs in high volume, labor intensive, repetitive operations: in-process gaging tool for controlling processes and correcting trends.
5. **Hardness Testing**
6. **Tensile Testing**
