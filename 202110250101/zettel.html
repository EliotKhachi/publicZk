        <p>Quality control inspections are regulated services that verify product or process standards (the right part/assembly/process at the right place at the right time)</p>
        <h2 id="types-related-to-quantity-and-shipment">Types Related to Quantity and Shipment</h2>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Sample Checking</strong> - Performed for a small # of items from a bigger batch.</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-Production Inspections (PPI)</strong> - Assesses quality and quantity of raw materials and components prior to production.</li>
        <li><strong>During Production Inspection (DPI)</strong> - Done for products in continuous production that must adhere to strict, timely requirements. Performed early, generally when 10-15% of the intended batch is completed.</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-Shipment Inspection (PSI)</strong> - Performed when ~80% of products are packed.</li>
        <li><strong>Piece by Piece Inspection (or Sorting Inspection)</strong> - 100% of goods are inspected, before or after packaging.</li>
        <li><strong>Loading and unloading supervision</strong> - Ensure product information and quantity, packaging compliance, shipper container condition, and loading and unloading processes all meet pre-determined standards.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="specific-tests-and-technologies">Specific Tests and Technologies</h2>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Metal Detection</strong> - Crucial for products not intending to contain metal</li>
        <li><strong>Visual Inspection</strong> - Detecting suface flaws (corrosion, contamination, surface finish, discontinuities on joints: welds, seals, solder connections)</li>
        <li><strong>Coordinate measuring machines (CMM)</strong> - Inspects dimensions with probes and arms</li>
        <li><strong>Machine Vision</strong> - Can be used for various things to improve accuracy and reduce costs in high volume, labor intensive, repetitive operations: in-process gaging tool for controlling processes and correcting trends.</li>
        <li><strong>Hardness Testing</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Tensile Testing</strong></li>
        </ol>
