<p>What makes personalities interesting arenâ€™t their particular type, but rather their degree of potency and nuance.</p>
<p>No one likes an extremely ordinary person but similarly someone who is implausibly unique and strange is simply regarded as impossible or not genuine.</p>
<p>Writeres strike a balance between the two and create characters with a degree of ordinariness to be relatable and believable while exaggerating a portion of their characters to add nuance, depth, emotion, conflict, and even relatability. ## References <em>The Idiot</em> by Dostoevsky: Part 4, pgs 1 &amp; 2 of Ch. 1</p>
