# Interesting Personalities are Ordinary With Some Nuance 

What makes personalities interesting aren't their particular type, but rather their degree of potency and nuance.

No one likes an extremely ordinary person but similarly someone who is implausibly unique and strange is simply regarded as impossible or not genuine.

Writeres strike a balance between the two and create characters with a degree of ordinariness to be relatable and believable while exaggerating a portion of their characters to add nuance, depth, emotion, conflict, and even relatability.
