1. Vector network analyzer (VNA)- Are used to test component specifications and verify subsystems. For any *network*, i.e. cellphone 3G/4G/5G, office Wi-Fi, wireless LAN, there exists a certain network analyzer tool to monitor performance and diagnose issues.
	* R&D, manufacturing, and component engineers use VNAs at various stages in product development.
	* System designers/System engineers need component specifications verified in order to assess whether the subsystem or system meets its specifications and fulfills its purpose.
 
2. Spectrum analyzer
3. High-speed oscilloscope
