        <p>Serial communication is the process of sending data one bit at a time, sequentially, over one communication channel or computer bus. This is in contrast to parallel communication.<br />
        <strong>Recall: A wire can only send data by pulling that line high or low</strong></p>
        <h2 id="how-can-you-make-sense-of-1s-and-0s-coming-from-a-single-wire">How can you make sense of 1s and 0s coming from a single wire?</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Ensure that the transmitter and the receiver agree on what serial communication protocol is being used, for example <a href="../202111020424/README.md">I2C Communication</a>.</li>
        <li>The 1s and 0s (bits) on the data bus occur in parallel with a <a href="../202305300022/README.md">Clock Bus</a>.</li>
        <li>The bits and the transitions between them are interpreted with respect to the clock bus.</li>
        <li>The data and clock buses have start and stop signatures used to group bits together to form integers or ASCII characters.</li>
