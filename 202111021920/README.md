# Serial Communication  

Serial communication is the process of sending data one bit at a time, sequentially, over one communication channel or computer bus. This is in contrast to parallel communication.  

**Recall: A wire can only send data by pulling that line high or low**

1. The data bus always sends data in parallel with a [Clock Bus](../202305300022/README.md).  
2. Similar to the clock bus,
2. The data bus contains start and stop signatures
With start and stop signatures in the data line

the foby working alongside the clock bus, 

## Different Methods of Data Exchange

* **Simplex** - One device is the sender and the other is the receiver at *all* times, i.e. television and radio.

* **Half Duplex** - One device is the sender and the other is the receiver at *any given* time, but not at the *same* time. If the sender transmits, then the receiver can accept and cannot send and vice versa. I.e. the internet (laptop sends a request for a webpage, the web server processes the request and sends back the information)

* **Full Duplex** - The most widely used communication in the world. Both the sender and receiver can transmit and receive at the same time, i.e. your smartphone.
