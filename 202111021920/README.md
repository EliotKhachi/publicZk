# Serial Communication 

Serial communication is a common approach for transferring information between data processing equipment and *peripherals*.

## Different Methods of Data Exchange

* **Simplex** - One device is the sender and the other is the receiver at *all* times, i.e. television and radio.

* **Half Duplex** - One device is the sender and the other is the receiver at *any given* time, but not at the *same* time. If the sender transmits, then the receiver can accept and cannot send and vice versa. I.e. the internet (laptop sends a request for a webpage, the web server processes the request and sends back the information)

* **Full Duplex** - The most widely used communication in the world. Both the sender and receiver can transmit and receive at the same time, i.e. your smartphone.
