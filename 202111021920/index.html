<h1 id="serial-communication">Serial Communication</h1>
<p>Serial communication is the process of sending data one bit at a time, sequentially, over one communication channel or computer bus. This is in contrast to parallel communication.<br />
<strong>Recall: A wire can only send data by pulling that line high or low</strong></p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Ensure that the transmitter and the receiver agree on what serial communication protocol is being used, for example <a href="../202111020424/README.md">I2C Communication</a>.<br />
</li>
<li>The 1s and 0s (bits) on the data bus occur in parallel with a <a href="../202305300022/README.md">Clock Bus</a>.<br />
</li>
<li>The bits and the transitions between them are interpreted with respect to the clock bus.<br />
</li>
<li>The data and clock buses have start and stop signatures used to group bits together to form integers or ASCII characters.</li>
