# Engaging With People With Trust Issues

Some people have trust issues and assume bad intentions from the moment you meet them.  

In situations where the relationship is still very early or, better yet, you've only just met, it may be best to just move on to another opportunity for friendship, business, romance, etc..  

Should you attempt to "win them over" or gain their trust? Is it even worth the effort when there are better people to spend your time and energy on? [[The Abundance Mindset](https://github.com/EliotKhachi//publicZk/tree/main/202308040125)].
