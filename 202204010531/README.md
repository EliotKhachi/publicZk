# Packages - Java 
## What
Packages are just folders. They are used to organize your program files in an intuitive and logical structure.  

## How
* Packages can be made within the IDE or by actually creating directories/folders where your project is located. 
* To add a particular java file to a package...
	1. First make sure that file is in the corresponding directory.  
	2. Then add "package \<project name\>.\<category\>.\<sub-category\>.\<etc.\>;" to the top of the file.
	3. You're done!
	4. To import a java file/class that is in a different package into your current java file/class, add "import \<project name\>.\<category\>.\<sub-category\>.\<etc.\>;" to the top of file.
