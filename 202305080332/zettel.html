        <h2 id="what-is-it">What is it</h2>
        <p>Capacitors store charge. They are kind of like mini-batteries. They have a body and two leads. The body is composed of two sheets of conductive material with a dielectric material (an insulator) in the middle.</p>
        <p>Capacitors have a voltage rating, the maximum voltage it can handle, and a <em>capacitance</em> value, the amount of charge it can store.</p>
        <p>Once a capacitor has stored charge, usually from a battery, it can then discharge to power electrical components, such as an LED.</p>
        <h2 id="nomenclature">Nomenclature</h2>
        <p>The longer lead is the anode (+) and the short is the cathode (-). Some may denote the cathode lead with a <code>-</code> symbol on one side of the body.</p>
        <h2 id="types">Types</h2>
        <p><strong>Electrolytic</strong> - Polarized.<br />
        <strong>Ceramic Disc Capacitor</strong> - Not polarized (either lead can be the cathode/anode). Also generally have lower capacitance ratings than electrolytic capacitors.<br />
        <strong>Poly Film Capacitor</strong> - Also not polarized.</p>
        <h2 id="calculations">Calculations</h2>
        <p>Capacitance (C) is measured in units of Farads (F). Small circuits typically use capacitors in units of microfarads or nanofarads.</p>
        <p><code>T = RC</code><br />
        <code>T</code> - Tau, the time constant, represents the amount of seconds (s) it takes for the capacitor to reach 63% of its charge. It takes <code>4T</code> seconds to reach 98% of its charge.<br />
        <code>R</code> - The resistance, in ohms, of the circuit.<br />
        <code>C</code> - The capacitance, in farads, of the capacitor.</p>
        <p><strong>Capacitors in Series</strong> <code>1/Q_total = 1/Q_1 + 1/Q_2 + ... 1/Q_N</code> <strong>Capacitors in Parallel</strong> <code>Q_total = Q_1 + Q_2 + ... Q_N</code></p>
