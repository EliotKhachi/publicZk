# Capacitors 

## What is it
Capacitors store charge. They are kind of like mini-batteries. They have a body and two leads. The body is composed of two sheets of conductive material with a dielectric material (an insulator) in the middle.  

Capacitors have a voltage rating, the maximum voltage it can handle, and a *capacitance* value, the amount of charge it can store.   

Once a capacitor has stored charge, usually from a battery, it can then discharge to power electrical components, such as an LED.   

## Nomenclature
The longer lead is the anode (+) and the short is the cathode (-). Some may denote the cathode lead with a `-` symbol on one side of the body.   

## Types
**Electrolytic** - Polarized.  
**Ceramic Disc Capacitor** - Not polarized (either lead can be the cathode/anode). Also generally have lower capacitance ratings than electrolytic capacitors.    
**Poly Film Capacitor** - Also not polarized.  

## Calculations
Capacitance (C) is measured in units of Farads (F). Small circuits typically use capacitors in units of microfarads or nanofarads.  

`T = RC`  
`T` - Tau, the time constant, represents the amount of seconds (s) it takes for the capacitor to reach 63% of its charge. It takes `4T` seconds to reach 98% of its charge.   
`R` - The resistance, in ohms, of the circuit.  
`C` - The capacitance, in farads, of the capacitor.  

**Capacitors in Series**
`1/Q_total = 1/Q_1 + 1/Q_2 + ... 1/Q_N`
**Capacitors in Parallel**
`Q_total = Q_1 + Q_2 + ... Q_N`
