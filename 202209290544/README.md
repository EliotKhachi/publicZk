# 5 Steps in Program Design by Elon Musk 

1. Question the requirements  

2. Simplify. Remove the part or process  

3. Optimize  

4. Accelerate production/processes that are already in motion  

5. Automate

Whenever you do something new, in all likelihood, you will fail. None of the reasons why the Starships would blow up during testing were on the "risk mitigations" list. You can't predict the future. Take this to heart and you will view your setbacks not as failures but as part of the *necessary* process of iterating and learning.
