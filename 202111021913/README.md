# UART  

UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter and refers to an internal hardware module that is used for *serial communication*.

## Two Forms

* UART - Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter

* USART - Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter

*Synchronous* type of transmitters generate the data clock and sends it to the receiver to communicate with the receiver properly.

*Asychronous* type of transmitters generates the data clock internally and doesn't send a clock signal to the receiver, so both devices must be using the same *baud rate* to ensure proper communication.
