# Building Circuits - SAFETY

## Things to Look Out For
* When connecting peripheral devices, be weary of the voltage and amperage ratings of each device's pins.
	* Look up these values in the devices' datasheets.
	* i.e. When connecting an LCD display to an STM32F0xx, note that the processor is powered with 3.3V and the display with 5.0V. Not all the pins on the processor are 5.0V tolerant.
