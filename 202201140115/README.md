# LRE Propellant Fraction 

The *propellant fraction* is a parameter used to guide the design of a rocket, particularly while neglecting the influence of vehicle structural weight.  

It is defined as the ratio of the total propellant weight to the fueled vehicle weight without payload.  

Mathematically:  

PF = mp/(mp + ms)  

, where PF is the propellant fraction, mp is the total propellant mass, and ms is the tota    l structural mass of the rocket.
