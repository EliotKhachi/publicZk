<h1 id="lre-propellant-fraction">LRE Propellant Fraction</h1>
<p>The <em>propellant fraction</em> is a parameter used to guide the design of a rocket, particularly while neglecting the influence of vehicle structural weight.</p>
<p>It is defined as the ratio of the total propellant weight to the fueled vehicle weight without payload.</p>
<p>Mathematically:</p>
<p>PF = mp/(mp + ms)</p>
<p>, where PF is the propellant fraction, mp is the total propellant mass, and ms is the tota l structural mass of the rocket.</p>
