<h1 id="scram-authentication">SCRAM Authentication</h1>
<p>In cryptography, <em>SCRAM</em> stands for the <strong>Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism</strong>.</p>
<p>SCRAM is a secure password authentication protocol that can authenticate a user to a server. It has several advantages over basic password authentication:</p>
<pre><code>* does not reveal the user&#39;s cleartext password to the server  
* is designed to prevent replay attacks   
* enables the use of Channel Binding - [202209300625](../202209300625) - Channel Binding  
* can support multiple cryptographic hash functions  
    * currently, PostgreSQL only supports SCRAM using SHA-256   </code></pre>
