# Exoskeleton - MVP 

## What is it
An exoskeleton is an extension of the human body that makes us faster, stronger, and more durable.  

## Users
Potential beneficiaries of this technology (users) include  
1. military personnel for use in on-the-ground combat zones  
2. firemen in the field   

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
An entire exoskeleton that enhances movement of the arms, legs, torso, and back, is quite a big project. Let's brainstorm other smaller projects that would pose as a better MVP.   

**Focusing on Body Parts** - One way to decide on an MVP in this case is to focus on a particular body part first:  
1. Legs - Every person exerting a lot of effort and physical activity will constantly have his/her legs under load. What if we can focus on alleviating load on the legs for as many people as possible?  
2. Arms - Every once in a while, incredible strength is needed to push, pull, or lift something. Enhancers for the arms for just a single member in a unit/team would give that team entirely new capabilities.  

**Modularizing the Exoskeleton** - Another way to approach an MVP is to sell a *modular* joint. This is a joint that can be fine-tuned and fitted by the user depending on where it is being placed on the body. This way, we can focus on the design of a single joint instead of an entire exoskeleton for our MVP. Later we can consider linking joints to form something more exoskeleton-esque.
