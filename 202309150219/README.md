# EC2 Instance Types

Different AWS EC2 instance types strike a different balance between:  
* Compute (C class) - Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors.  
* Memory (R, X1, High Memory, z1 classes) - fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.  
* Storage - Great for storange-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage.
