# Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

You can register Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to template the information required to launch an instance. This enforces standardization, thereby simplifying your application infrastructure, and improves boot times.  

## What do you define with an AMI?
* Region (AMIs can only be used in the region they are defined)  
* Launch permissions (who can use the AMI)  
* Operating System
* Architecture (32 or 64 bit)  
* Storage ([Amazon EBS](../202309120445) or [EC2 Instance Store](../202309120447))
