# CSS Basics

CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. You use it to create a beautiful, smooth-flowing website. More specifically, you use it to augment your traditional elements on the webpage produced by HTML; for example, you can use CSS for basic text styling like *color* and *size*, or for more complex effects like *animation*.  

## The Language
CSS is a rule-based language, which means that you define rules for the elements in your html file. i.e.  
```CSS
	h1 {
	    color: red;
	    font-size: 5em;
	}
```
In the above example, CSS would display your title tag to the webpage, h1, in large, red text.

**Components of a CSS Rule**
* *Selector* (`h1`) - *selects* the HTML element that we are going to style.  
* *Curly Braces* (`{}`) - defines area for CSS *declarations* to be made.  
* *Declaration* - specifies the *property* and *value* pairs that tell us what we're going to change and how we're going to change it.  
	* *Property* (`color` and `font-size`) - specifies the property(s) of the *selected* HTML element we'd like to change.  
	* *Value* (`red` and `5em`) - specifies the value of the property(s) we'd like.  

Property and value pairs are written on the same line, are separated by a `:`, and end with a `;`.  

A CSS stylesheet will contain many rules, written one after the other.
