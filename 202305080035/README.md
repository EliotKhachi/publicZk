# Switches

A switch is used to connect and disconnect wires in circuits.  

## Types of Switches
*SPST* - Single Pole Single Throw   
* Connects a single wire in the ON position and disconnects it in the OFF position.

*SPDT* - Single Pole Double Throw  
* Connects to wire `A` in the ON position and *switches* to wire `B` in the OFF position, thereby disconnecting `A`.  

*DPST* - Double Pole Single Throw
* Connects to wires `A` *and* `B` in the ON position and disconnects them in the OFF position.  

*DPDT* - Double Pole Double Throw
* Connects to wires `A` *and* `B` in the ON position, and *switches* to wires `C` and `D` in the OFF position, thereby disconnecting `A` and `B`.  

## So What is a Pole and a Throw?
The number of poles is the number of switches.  
The number of throws is the number of positions that a single switch can support.
