# Switches 

A switch is used to connect and disconnect wires in circuits.  

## Types of Switches

The type of switch is based on how many *poles* and *throws* it has.   
* The number of poles is the number of switches.  
* The number of throws is the number of positions for each switch.  

*SPST* - Single Pole Single Throw   
* Connects a single wire in the ON position and disconnects it in the OFF position.

*SPDT* - Single Pole Double Throw  
* Connects to wire `A` in the ON position and connects to wire `B` in the OFF position(disconnecting `A` in the process).  

*DPST* - Double Pole Single Throw
* Connects to wires `A` *and* `B` in the ON position and disconnects them in the OFF position.  

*DPDT* - Double Pole Double Throw
* Connects to wires `A` *and* `B` in the ON position, and connects to wires `C` and `D` in the OFF position (disconnecting `A` and `B` in the process).
