<p>A switch is used to connect and disconnect wires in circuits.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-switches">Types of Switches</h2>
<p>The type of switch is based on how many <em>poles</em> and <em>throws</em> it has.<br />
* The number of poles is the number of switches.<br />
* The number of throws is the number of positions for each switch.</p>
<p><em>SPST</em> - Single Pole Single Throw<br />
* Connects a single wire in the ON position and disconnects it in the OFF position.</p>
<p><em>SPDT</em> - Single Pole Double Throw<br />
* Connects to wire <code>A</code> in the ON position and connects to wire <code>B</code> in the OFF position(disconnecting <code>A</code> in the process).</p>
<p><em>DPST</em> - Double Pole Single Throw * Connects to wires <code>A</code> <em>and</em> <code>B</code> in the ON position and disconnects them in the OFF position.</p>
<p><em>DPDT</em> - Double Pole Double Throw * Connects to wires <code>A</code> <em>and</em> <code>B</code> in the ON position, and connects to wires <code>C</code> and <code>D</code> in the OFF position (disconnecting <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> in the process).<br />
