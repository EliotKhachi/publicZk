# Gas Generator 

* This may go without saying but I'll state it here for clarity: A gas generator (GG) is a device used to generate gas.  

* In rocket propulsion, *GGs* are typically used to power [turbopumps](../202201100451) in rocket engines. They may also be used to power electrical generators and hydraulic pumps onboard the rocket.


* The German V-2 rocket used hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by sodium permanganate in its gas generator system to drive a turbopump to pressurize the main LOX-ethanol propellants.

* The Saturn V F-1 and Space Shuttle main engines used a highly fuel-rich combination of the main propellants in their gas generator systems to drive the turbopump to keep flame temperatures low. This is called a gas generator combustion cycle.
