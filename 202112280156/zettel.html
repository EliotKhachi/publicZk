        <p><strong>Critical Dimensions</strong> * Depend on the part's function &amp; fit requirements * Non-critical dimensions are the areas of the part that don't come into close proximity with the mating assembly components, do not impact the design intent. nor impact the overall performance of the part. * They are partly subjective; you likely to discuss the part in question with manfuacturing &amp; engineering personnel to fully grasp the critical dimensions.</p>
        <p><strong>Basic Dimensions</strong> * Theoretically exact location or geometry of features. * Usually accompanied by a GD&amp;T symbol and feature control frame to attribute the dimension a tolerance. (see <em>Feature Control Frame</em>).</p>
        <p><strong>Tolerance Dimensions</strong> * Used to call out a feature's size or location without applying GD&amp;T principles to it. * Types of Tolerances: * 5.125 +/- 0.125 -&gt; Bilateral Equal plus/minus * 5.250, 5.000 -&gt; Limit * R0.3 MAX -&gt; Single Limit Maximum * R0.3 MIN</p>
        <p><strong>Reference Dimensions</strong> * Given to any features that are just for reference or visualization purposes. * These dimensions do not get inspected. * Called out using parantheses, i.e. (5.125)</p>
        <p><strong>Datums</strong> * A <em>datum</em> is a theoretically exact plane or axis. I.e. The plane of the top surface of the table upon which a part sits. * A <em>datum feature</em> is a physical feature on the part that can be touched and that is specified in order to establish a theoretically exact datum. I.e. The bottom surface of the part * A <em>datum feature simulator</em> is a precision embodiment used to define the location of the datum feature in space. I.e. The top of the polished granite surface (could also be a gauge pin or machine tool bed).</p>
        <p><strong>Material Conditions</strong> * Maximum material condition - When the feature is the heaviest. Denoted by a captital "M" inside a circle within a feature control frame. * I.e. The largest diameter of the pin within its size tolerance. * I.e. The smallest diameter of the hole within its size tolerance. * Least material condition - When the feature is the lighest. Dentoed by a capital "L" inside a circle withina feature control frame. * I.e. The smallest diameter of the pin within its size tolerance. * I.e. The largest diameter of the hole within its size tolerance. * Material conditions are used to specify how the position tolerance must be interpreted. * I.e. Suppose we have a hole with a diameter tolerance of +/- 0.1, and its position tolerance is +/-0.05 at the maximum material condition. This tells us the position tolerance at the maximum material condition of the hole is when it is smallest, or D - 0.1. However, if the hole happens to be larger than the maximum material condition, say D + 0.1, but still within its size tolerance, the difference can be attributed as <em>bonus tolerance</em>. In this case the <em>bonus tolerance</em> is 0.1 meaning the <em>total</em> position tolerance is now 0.2 instead of 0.1 as before.</p>
