# The Categorical Imperative

The Categorical Imperative is, according to Emmanuel Kant, a principle of practical rationality that is also the supreme principle of morality.  

## First Formulation
*Act only in accordance with that maxim which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law.*

Basically what's being said here is that you can claim an action is moral only if you would like everyone else to also do it.  

*Example: Nobody wants their stuff stolen. If everyone stole, then, chances are, you would be stolen from. Stealing is therefore immoral.*
