# Introduction to Web Development 


## Types of Developers
1. Front-end - Focused on the end-user's experience and what they can actually see
2. Back-end - Concerned with what actually happens when the user interacts with what they see. What information is being sent where, and how?  
3. Full-stack - Integrates the front-end with the back-end.  

## The Developer Environment
All you need is a web browser and a text editor!  

## Languages
