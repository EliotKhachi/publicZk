# Reynold's Number

The Reynold's Number is a dimensionless parameter useful in characterizing whether a flow is *laminar* or *turbulent*.  

## Component Parameters
The Reynold's Number is calculated by multiplying the fluid's *density*, *velocity*, and *characteristic length*, and dividing its *dynamic viscosity*.  

## What it Means
Essentially, the Reynold's Number is the ratio of a fluid's inertia forces to its frictional forces due to viscosity. If the viscuous forces dominate, the flow is *laminar*. If the inertial forces forces dominate, the flow is *turbulent*.
