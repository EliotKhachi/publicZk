# The Waterfall Project Management Approach for Hardware is a Feature Not a Bug

[Agile Software Development ](../202402040346) is praised for its short duty cycles and fast, steady progress. Why can't hardware development be done in the same way?  

Put simply, it costs more to "deploy" (design, build, test, and manufacture at scale) hardware.  
Each hardware iteration can cost thousands or millions of dollars. For this reason, it is more cost-effective to iterate more slowly: perform rigorous analysis, make more design decisions per iteration, etc..  

For this reason, hardware development is typically done with a more "waterfall" project management approach. Since more is at stake if a mistake is made (or a requirement changes), more resources are devoted to communicating with the customer, budget, schedule, design, analysis, test, risk identification/mitigation, etc.
