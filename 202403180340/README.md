# Authentication vs Authorization

*Authenticated* users can log in or access the application while *authorized* users have certain privileges/permissions within the application.  

## Example
You are going to your friend's house.  
Your friend *Authenticates* that you are the person you say you are, and you are let in his house.  

You notice certain doors are closed within the house. You are not *authorized* to use open those doors.
