# Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method 

* The Zettelkasten Method is a method of note-taking intended to keep your notes alives, connect ideas, and scale automatically to avoid creating a bloated mess over time through normal note-taking.

* Each note has a fixed address and this address tells us the *relative position* of the note: its position relative to other notes. A fundamental principle of the Zettelkasten is that any given note has no absolute position, their location is strictly defined by its relationship to other notes. Each note must have a relationship
	* The first note is assigned the number **1**, the second, unrelated note the number **2**, and so on. if you want to continue the first note or inject something into its content, create the note **1a**. To continue off this note, create the note **1b**
