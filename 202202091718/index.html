<p>The Zettelkasten Method is a personal tool for thinking and writing, invented by Niklas Luhmann, a German sociologist.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-problem">What’s the problem?</h2>
<p>Standard note-taking makes it difficult to revisit, interact with, and add onto your notes.</p>
<p>I’m sure we’ve all been here before: over time, your collection of notes becomes a bloated mess of notebooks and folders. It’s hard to find what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>Standard note-taking doesn’t reap you the benefits of note-taking in the first place, which is to expand your knowledge base.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>The Zettelkasten method solves these problems with 3 key traits:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It’s hyper-textual</li>
<li>It adheres to the <em>Principle of Atomicity</em><br />
</li>
<li>It is personal</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>First</strong>, the zettelkasten is a collection of texts that refer to and expand on each other. It’s focused on forming relationships. It’s focused on <em>connecting</em> rather than <em>collecting</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, each note should be <em>atomic</em>, meaning it contains a one unit of knowledge: a single thought. These units are the atoms that we build molecules with. For this reason, each note should be relatively short. By making notes atomic, there is no ambiguity about what connection you are making when you link two notes together.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, this is <em>your</em> zettelkasten. Treat it like your second brain. When you want to dive into a new topic, jump right in and start forming new thoughts that build upon your old thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How Does it Work</h2>
<p><em>Zettel</em> means <em>slip</em>.<br />
<em>Kasten</em> means <em>box</em>.</p>
<p>Luhmann’s slipbox involved many drawers with slips of notes inside. He would open a drawer (broadly labeled), and look through the slips. Each slip is uniquely numbered, and <em>points</em> to other slips in the zettelkasten.</p>
