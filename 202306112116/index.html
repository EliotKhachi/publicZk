<h1 id="establish-an-i2c-bus-on-your-stm32-microcontroller">Establish an I2C Bus on your STM32 Microcontroller</h1>
<p>In STM32CubeIDE, you can easily configure your clock (SCL) and data (SDA) lines for I2C communication.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open your projectâ€™s .ioc file in the editor, and under the <em>Pinout &amp; Configuration</em> tab, expand the <em>Connectivity</em> category.</li>
<li>Click on an I2C channel, for example, <em>I2C1</em>. The window should expand, showing the I2C configuration options. Change the I2C mode from <em>Disable</em> to <em>I2C</em>.</li>
<li>Change any other Configuration settings you would like, such as the <em>I2C Speed Mode</em>.</li>
<li>You should see the respective pins light up green on your microcontroller pinout diagram to the right.</li>
