# Redirecting Standard Output

First, what even is [Standard Output](../202305212216/README.md)?

Another place you can put the output of a command is in a file. Use the `>` shell operator to *redirect* standard output into a file, overwriting its contents. To append to a file, use the `>>` operator.  

## Example
`$ ls > file1`  
`$ cat file1`  
`Desktop Documents Downloads Pictures Music`
