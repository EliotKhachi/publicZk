# GD&T Datums

* A *datum* is a theoretically exact plane or axis. I.e. The plane of the top surface of the table upon which a part sits.

* A *datum feature* is a physical feature on the part that can be touched and that is specified in order to establish a theoretically exact datum. I.e. The bottom surface of the part

* A *datum feature simulator* is a precision embodiment used to define the location of the datum feature in space. I.e. The top of the polished granite surface (could also be a gauge pin or machine tool bed).
