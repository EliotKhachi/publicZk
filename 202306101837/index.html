<p>Most, if not all, STM32 microcontrollers can establish at least one I2C bus, giving you the ability to read/write data among 128 devices. <a href="../202111020424/README.md">I2C Communication</a></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <a href="../202306112116/README.md">Establish an I2C Bus on your STM32 Microcontroller</a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Familiarize yourself with your slave device(s) 1. What is your deviceâ€™s 7-bit or 8-bit address?<br />
2. What do you need to configure on your device before using it? I.e. what registers do you need to write to for configuration settings such as waking it up, setting a sample rate speed, etc.?<br />
3. <strong>Step 3:</strong> <a href="../202306112223/README.md">Use STM32 HAL libraries to read and write data via I2C</a></p>
