        <p>A hybrid cloud is a mixed computing environment where applications are run using a combination of computing, storage, and services in different environments—public clouds and private clouds, including on-premises data centers or “edge” locations.</p>
        <p>The purpose of a hybrid cloud is for customers to have more physical control over the security of their data, while still taking advantage of the cloud.</p>
