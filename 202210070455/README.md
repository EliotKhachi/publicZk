Directories are analagous to folders or drawers in a filing cabinet, where the files are the documents. Directories organize files in a hierarchical file system, resembling a *tree* structure. 

The top-most directory in such a file system is called the *root* directory, like the root of a tree or the filing cabinet itself.
