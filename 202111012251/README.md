# Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)
An Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) is a device that takes an analog signal or voltage, specifically in the form of a wave over time, and converts it into a number (a digital voltage?)

ADCs are used to obtain a useful value out of analog signals that originate from sensors such as thermostats, accelerometers, gyrocopes, laser/sonar/radar/lidar/, etc.
