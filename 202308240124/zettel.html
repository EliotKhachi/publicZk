        <p>There is no reason to be nervous when speaking to customers and conducting sales.</p>
        <p>I vividly remember a 3-month period during the summer of 2021, just after graduating college, wherein I joined a team to sell solar panels. Every day, we would go out to our assigned neighborhoods and knock on doors to speak to and prospect potential solar panel customers. We would assess their electricity bill and create a plan that made sense for them financially. Every day was difficult to get started and some were difficult all the way through. But some days I felt a surge of positivity and candidness take over me as I strolled through the neighborhood and spoke to people. I felt on top of the world and enjoyed what I was doing. These were the moments when I actually made the sale (scheduled the sit-down).</p>
        <p>The reason that sometimes I was nervous was because I was in <a href="../202308040127/zettel.html">The Scarcity Mindset</a>. I was caught up in how the sale would benefit me. What I can gain from the situation. What I had at stake and the opportunity I can let slip. This is a false sense of scarcity because <strong>there's always the next door to knock</strong>. I truly had nothing to lose. When I was radiating trust and positivity, I had adopted <a href="../202308040125/zettel.html">The Abundance Mindset</a>. The reason I was there was to help other people meet their financial goals.</p>
