# Don't get caught up in making the sale

It's important to understand that sales is mutually beneficial for both the salesman and the customer, because salesmen often ignore customer needs and get caught up in how they are benefiting. Sales is about understanding the customer's needs, building rapport, and providing value. It's about establishing a relationship rather than just making a transaction.  

I vividly remember a 3-month period during the summer of 2021, just after graduating college, when I joined a team to sell solar panels. Every day, we would go out to our assigned neighborhoods and knock on doors to speak to and prospect potential solar customers. Knocking was hard. Some days were real rough. I couldn't stand getting rejected over and over again.  

But some days were different. Some days, I felt a surge of positivity and candidness take over me as I strolled through the neighborhood. I felt on top of the world and enjoyed what I was doing. I would shrug off the rude homeowners who shut the door in my face. "Oh well, their loss", I would say to myself. These were the moments when I actually felt like I was connecting to people and getting to the bottom of why they wouldn't (or would) get solar. These were the moments I managed to schedule sit-downs, which often led to the sale thanks to our great team.  

The reason I was miserable and nervous to speak to people was because I was in [The Scarcity Mindset](../202308040127). I was caught up in how the sale would benefit me. What I can gain from the situation. What I had at stake. The opportunity I could blow. This is a false sense of scarcity because **there's always the next door to knock**. I forgot that I truly had nothing to lose and I was offering tremendous value. The neighborhood is lucky to have me! When I was radiating candidness and positivity, I remembers that I was there to help other people meet their financial goals; I had adopted [The Abundance Mindset](./202308040125).
