# INCOSE Certification Study Guide

All questions on the INCOSE knowledge exam can be traced to the SE Handbook, but not all aspects of the handbook will be found on the knowledge exam.  

There is a minimum requirement for both depth and breadth of experience and knowledge; greater depth of knowledge in one area does not compensate for another.
