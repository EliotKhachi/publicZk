# Systems Thinking  

## What it's all about
* Systems thinking is a perspective for solving problems.

* It's concerned with wholes and their properties

* Systems consist of hierarchies that relate to each other through numerous interfaces, each having their own kind of requirements

## Reductionism and What is Wrong With it
In the 17th century, Descartes suggested we solve problems by successively break problems down to a level where sufficient understanding exists, and if all sub-problems are solved, then an overall solution to the problem would seem to be a certain result. This is called *reductionism*.  

That is NOT the system solution!

The limit to reductionism is that as systems get more complex, small changes in "sub-problem" (subsystem) solutions can propogate 1) across neighboring subsystems leading to failures in their required performance, or 2) upward leading to major errors in the overal required system performance.

In other words, Your "fix" or design improvement to a little part could then cause failure of another part you did not think about. Unintended consequences!

## Connectedness
"If you wish to understand a system, and so be in a position to predict its behavior, it is necessary to study the system as a whole. Cutting it up into bits for study is likely to destroy the system's connectedness, and hence the system itself."  

"If you wish to influence or control the behavior of a ystem, you must act on the system as a whole. Tweaking it in one place in the hope that nothing will happen in another is doomed to failure -- that's what connectedness is all about" 

- D. Sherwood, *Seeing the Forest for the Trees: A Manager's guide to Applying Systems Thinking, 2002*.

## Examples

1. The F/A-18 Hornet developed by McDonnell Douglas is a twin-engine, supersonic, all-weather, carrier-capable, multirole combat jet, designed as both a fighter and attack aircraft. [McDonnel Douglas F/A-18 Hornet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F/A-18_Hornet)
* In an effort to compensate for lift loss due to wing flow separation at angles of attack at ~35 degrees, A chine was implemented close to the fuselage and in-front of the leading-edge of the wing to generate flow vortices.  
* The burst vortex caused unsteady flow to hit the vertical tails, causing buffet vibrations and reducing the aircraft fatigue life by ~60%.
* A permanent, efficient solution was implemented by adding vents vetween the chine and vertical tail
