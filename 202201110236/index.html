<h2 id="what-its-all-about">What it’s all about</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Systems thinking is a perspective for solving problems.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s concerned with wholes and their properties</p></li>
<li><p>Systems consist of hierarchies that relate to each other through numerous interfaces, each having their own kind of requirements</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reductionism-and-what-is-wrong-with-it">Reductionism and What is Wrong With it</h2>
<p>In the 17th century, Descartes suggested we solve problems by successively break problems down to a level where sufficient understanding exists, and if all sub-problems are solved, then an overall solution to the problem would seem to be a certain result. This is called <em>reductionism</em>.</p>
<p>That is NOT the system solution!</p>
<p>The limit to reductionism is that as systems get more complex, small changes in “sub-problem” (subsystem) solutions can propogate 1) across neighboring subsystems leading to failures in their required performance, or 2) upward leading to major errors in the overal required system performance.</p>
<p>In other words, Your “fix” or design improvement to a little part could then cause failure of another part you did not think about. Unintended consequences!</p>
<h2 id="connectedness">Connectedness</h2>
<p>“If you wish to understand a system, and so be in a position to predict its behavior, it is necessary to study the system as a whole. Cutting it up into bits for study is likely to destroy the system’s connectedness, and hence the system itself.”</p>
<p>“If you wish to influence or control the behavior of a ystem, you must act on the system as a whole. Tweaking it in one place in the hope that nothing will happen in another is doomed to failure – that’s what connectedness is all about”</p>

<li>The F/A-18 Hornet developed by McDonnell Douglas is a twin-engine, supersonic, all-weather, carrier-capable, multirole combat jet, designed as both a fighter and attack aircraft. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F/A-18_Hornet">McDonnel Douglas F/A-18 Hornet</a></li>

<ul>
<li>In an effort to compensate for lift loss due to wing flow separation at angles of attack at ~35 degrees, A chine was implemented close to the fuselage and in-front of the leading-edge of the wing to generate flow vortices.<br />
</li>
<li>The burst vortex caused unsteady flow to hit the vertical tails, causing buffet vibrations and reducing the aircraft fatigue life by ~60%.</li>
<li>A permanent, efficient solution was implemented by adding vents vetween the chine and vertical tail</li>
