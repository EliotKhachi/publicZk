        <ol>
        <li>Gestures - Movements, generally with the use of hands and/or body, used to communicate
        <ul>
        <li>Illustrative - Gestures that on their own do not mean anything, but have meaning when associated with words or phrases (e.g. waving hands, open/close palm movements, waving/trickling fingers).</li>
        <li>Emblem - Gestures that have a specific meaning (e.g. waving hello or goodbye, peace sign, finger pulling (come here), finger wagging (bad)).</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Deliberate Movement - "Work the room". Connect with people at different parts of the room. Walk around with purpose. Stop and look at people when making a point. Don't just pace around.</li>
        <li>Solid Eye Contact - Look at people long enough to make or finish a point, but not too long to make them uncomfortable. A good rule of thumb is 3-5 seconds of eye contact before moving onto the next person.</li>
        <li>Do Not Look Back at Slides - YOU are the visual aid. Facing your back to your audience disconnects your from them, bores them, and disengages them. Know your material well enough to engage people in a dialogue/conversation.</li>
        <li>Pause After Key Points - Give 1 or 2 second beats, and "lean in", to let your key ideas sink in a little bit.</li>
        </ol>
