        <p>The NIST Self-Assessment tool is a method by which to judge a MBE readiness level.</p>
        <p><strong>Level 0</strong> - Traditional design practices are utilized, drawings and other manual processes, to convey information.</p>
        <p><strong>Level 1</strong> - Drawings and other manual processes are derived from a common model, but are still disconnected.</p>
        <p><strong>Level 2</strong> - Drawing and model are starting to be managed together</p>
        <p><strong>Level 3</strong> - Models are beginning to become the focus. Model-Based Definition (MBD) is instantiated. Models contain some <em>PMI</em> <a href="../202110051806/zettel.html">202110051806</a> and drawings are used as supplemental documents.</p>
        <p><strong>Level 4</strong> - Increases the degree to which the model drives the process and drawings are no longer used.</p>
        <p><strong>Level 5</strong> - Begin to have an integrated manufacturing perspective and an integrated interal enterprise. The model is used to support decisions to such an extent that you're working with it in some nontraditional activities.</p>
        <p><strong>Level 6</strong> - Manufacturing is tightly integrated based on the model including the extended enterprise (refers to the entire supply chain using the model to communicate, with the model driving all associated activities).</p>
