# Reader

## Concept
A **reader** is a set of structured operations for reading bytes from an input stream.  

## What is a Reader REALLY? 
Reader operations can be byte-based or text-based. A `Scanner` is a reader that provides line-based methods for reading specific data types, and methods for reading everything all at once.  

Each reader has its own reading strategies.
