        <p>A <strong>reader</strong> is a set of structured operations for reading bytes from an input stream. A <strong>writer</strong> is a set of structured operations for writing bytes to an output stream. <a href="../202210070515/zettel.html">202210070515</a> - Streams</p>
        <p>Readers or writers, depending on their purpose, utilize operations that are byte-based, text-based, or other-based. Each reader or writer employs a different "strategy" for parsing through data.</p>
