## Features
1. **Complete SysML Modeling** - [9 Diagrams of SysML](../202403090209)  
2. **Requirements management**- req'mnt tracebility, model checking, test cases, automated req'mnts numbering and uniqueness, versioning control, and further customization therein.  
3. **Traceability** + built-in functions to find usages and dependencies:  
    * SysML Allocation  
    * Function to Operational Activity  
    * Operational Activity to Systems  
    * Resource Interactions  
    * Capability to Service  
    * Organizational resource responsibility for Projects  
4. **Model exports**: normal text, RTF, HTML, XML, Word, Excel 2007 files, and Java Doc.  
5. **Parametric modeling** - including capability to simulate systems given constraints (track dependencies and parameters throughout the lifecycle), conduct trade studies to capture design alternatives, and integrate with MS Excel, Matlab, Mathematica, and OpenModelica.  
6. **Parallel Development** - has a teamwork server to enable more than one developer to work with the same model.  

## Other More General Benefits
1. Configuration management and version control.  
2. Can assign permissions per person for accessing data in the teamwork server or projects.  
3. Interoperability - Collaborates with OMG and UML Diagram Interchange Group. Supports IBM doors, databases via CSV files, MS Excel, and other modeling tools.  
4. Adjustments/Tailoring - Built-in Domain Specific Language (DSL) customization engine  
5. Supports contraint expressions defined in the Object Constraint Language (OCL) (an extension of UML) to be added to any model element.
