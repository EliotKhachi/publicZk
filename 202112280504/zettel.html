        <li>Maximum material condition - When the feature is the heaviest. Denoted by a captital "M" inside a circle within a feature control fram e.
        <ul>
        <li>I.e. The largest diameter of the pin within its size t olerance</li>
        <li>I.e. The smallest diameter of the hole within its size tolerance.</li>

        <li>Least material condition - When the feature is the lighest. De ntoed by a capital "L" inside a circle withina feature control frame.
        <ul>
        <li>I.e. The smallest diameter of the pin within its size tolerances</li>
        <li>I.e. The largest diameter of the hole within its size tolerance.</li>
        <li>Material conditions are used to specify how the position toler ance must be interpreted.</li>
        <li>I.e. Suppose we have a hole with a diameter tolerance of +/- 0.1, and its position tolerance is +/-0.05 at the maximum material condition. This tells us the position tolerance at the maximum material condition of the hole is when it is smallest, or (D - 0.1). However, if the hole happens to be larger than the maximum material condition, say (D + 0.1), but still within its size tolerance, the difference can be attributed as <em>bonus tolerance</em>. In this case the <em>bonus tolerance</em> is 0.1 meaning the <em>total</em> position tolerance is now 0.2 instead of 0.1 as before.</li>
