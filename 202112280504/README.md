# GD&T Material Conditions 

1. Maximum material condition - When the feature is the heaviest.     Denoted by a captital "M" inside a circle within a feature control fram    e.
	* I.e. The largest diameter of the pin within its size t    olerance
	* I.e. The smallest diameter of the hole within its size     tolerance.
2. Least material condition - When the feature is the lighest. De    ntoed by a capital "L" inside a circle withina feature control frame.
	* I.e. The smallest diameter of the pin within its size     tolerances
	* I.e. The largest diameter of the hole within its size     tolerance.
	* Material conditions are used to specify how the position toler    ance must be interpreted.
	* I.e. Suppose we have a hole with a diameter tolerance of +/- 0.1, and its position tolerance is +/-0.05 at the maximum material condition. This tells us the position tolerance at the maximum material condition of the hole is when it is smallest, or (D - 0.1). However, if the hole happens to be larger than the maximum material condition, say (D + 0.1), but still within its size tolerance, the difference can be attributed as *bonus tolerance*. In this case the *bonus tolerance* is 0.1 meaning the *total* position tolerance is now 0.2 instead of 0.1 as before.
