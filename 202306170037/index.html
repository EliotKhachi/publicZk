<ol type="1">
<li>Resistors dissipate heat, making your circuit power inefficient.<br />
</li>
<li>You will experience voltage fluctuations. The voltage drop across the resistor depends on the current running through it, which depends on the load in your circuit. If the load in your circuit changes, so will the voltage.<br />
</li>
<li>You will gradually experience a voltage drop throughout your circuit. As you use up your battery, <em>its</em> supply voltage will drop. Consequently, the voltage after the resistor will drop.</li>
