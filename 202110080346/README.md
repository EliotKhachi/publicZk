# Habits  

## Key Questions
How do we start good habits or end bad ones?

## Understanding Habits  
Automatic responses to our everyday stimuli is absolutely necessary to function properly. Otherwise, the most mundane tasks would take up our brain capacity. This is why all habits serve you in some way. The habits you repeat (or don't repeat) largely determine your health, wealth, and happiness (Clear).

**The Habit Loop** - The elements of every habit *in practice*. 
1. **Cue** - The stimulus that evokes an emotional feeling.
2. **Craving** - The state of emotion that elicits action.
3. **Response** - The action of carrying out the habit.
4. **Reward** - The pleasure received as a result of carrying out the action.

## Replacing Habits  
It is very difficult to stop doing a "bad" habit without replacing it with a "good" one. I say "bad" in air-quotes because, again, all habits serve you in some way. So when choosing a replacement, ask yourself the following: How strongly do you really want to break the habit? How established is the problem habit? What are the consequences of not breaking the habit?

There are 3 main elements of every habit having to do with *formation and purpose* with various sub-elements

**Motivation**
1. *Pleasure/pain* - Taps into primitive circuit. Immediate payoff or downside.
2. *Hope/fear* - Sometimes more powerful in eliciting behavior than pleasure or pain itself, despite being *anticipatory* of something good (hope) or bad (fear).
3. *Social acceptance/rejection* - Human have a desire to live in social proximity and it is wired into us for other humans to accept us.

**Ability** - Equivalent to simiplicity. Uses 6 metrics:
1. *Time* - If something takes a short amount of time, it is considered simple and we are more likely to do it.
2. *Money* - Similar to *Time*, if something costs too much, we do not consider it simple.
3. *Physical effort* - Similar to *Money*, if something takes too much effort, we are less likeley to do it.
4. *Brain cycles* - 
5. *Social deviance* - If something deviates from the social norm, we are less likely to do it.
6. *Nonroutine* - If something deviates from our own personal routine, we are less likely to do it.

**Prompts** - Depending on your motivation and ability with respect to a task, certain stimuli can prompt you in the following ways: 
1. *Spark* - A prompt that leads to a form of motivation when you have low motivation and high ability. e.g. checking your email leads to fear, then you will likely adopt a habit to change that.
2. *Facilitator* - A prompt that leads to adopting a tool when you have high motivation low ability. e.g. you need to use a software tool that requires some technnical setup but you are tech averse, you are likely to use a tool that makes software easier to use.
3. *Signal* - A prompt that serves as a reminder -> immediatey leads to a behavior or response. Occurs when motivation and ability are high. e.g. If you love making brain smoothies, all you need is to see your blender in the kitchen to prompt you to make one.
