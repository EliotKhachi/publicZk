# Breadth First Search

*Breadth First Search (BFS)* is an algorithm for traversing an unweighted Graph or a Tree.

* BFS starts with the root node and explores each adjacent node before exploring node(s) at the next level.  

* BFS makes use of Queue for storing the visited nodes of the graph / tree
