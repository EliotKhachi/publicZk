# Types of Verification 

1. **Analysis** - Use of analytical techniques such as mathematical modeling, simulation. Generally used when a model or prototype is unavailable.   

2. **Demonstration** - Physical models or mock-ups. Actual operation of the end product by trained users to demonstrate extreme limits of system performance.  

3. **Inspection** - Visual examination of a realized end product. Used to verify physical design or specific manufacturer ID. Also can be used to verify a requirement as simple as "Shall have a yellow label with the words "CAUTION: HOT" on front face".  

4. **Test** -  The use of an end product to obtain data needed to verify performance directly or indirectly with analysis.
