# Diodes 

Diodes allow electricity to flow in only one direction: from the anode (+) to the cathode (-). Much like a check valve for fluids.  

Diodes in **Forward Bias Mode** are diodes that are allowing electricity to flow through it.   
Diodes in **Reverse Bias Mode** are diodes that are blocking the flow of electricity.  
In reality, reverse bias diodes do not completely stop the flow of electricity. Rather, they introduce a large voltage drop,. In fact, even forward bias diodes have a small voltage drop.  

Diodes in **Breakdown Mode** are diodes whose max voltage rating was exceeded and are now no longer properly functioning.
