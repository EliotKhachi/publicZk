        <p>Diodes allow electricity to flow in only one direction: from the anode (+) to the cathode (-). Much like a check valve for fluids.</p>
        <p>Diodes in <strong>Forward Bias Mode</strong> are diodes that are allowing electricity to flow through it.<br />
        Diodes in <strong>Reverse Bias Mode</strong> are diodes that are blocking the flow of electricity.<br />
        In reality, reverse bias diodes do not completely stop the flow of electricity. Rather, they introduce a large voltage drop,. In fact, even forward bias diodes have a small voltage drop.</p>
        <p>Diodes in <strong>Breakdown Mode</strong> are diodes whose max voltage rating was exceeded and are now no longer properly functioning.</p>
