# How VNAs Work 

VNAs are tools used to verify component specifications that correspond to *networks*, such as cellphone 3G/4G/5G or Wi-Fi.

A VNA is a device that produces a stimulus signal and has a set a of receivers. The produced signal acts as an input signal to the *device under test* (DUT), and the VNA performs two types of measurements using its receivers: transmission and reflection.

1. Transmission - refers to the output signal of the DUT.
	* Gain
	* Insertion loss/phase
	* Electrical length/delay and group delay
2. Reflection - refers to the stimulus signal being reflected back from the DUT rather than traveling through it.
