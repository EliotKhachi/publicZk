<h1 id="how-vnas-work">How VNAs Work</h1>
<p>VNAs are tools used to verify component specifications that correspond to <em>networks</em>, such as cellphone 3G/4G/5G or Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>A VNA is a device that produces a stimulus signal and has a set a of receivers. The produced signal acts as an input signal to the <em>device under test</em> (DUT), and the VNA performs two types of measurements using its receivers: transmission and reflection.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Transmission - refers to the output signal of the DUT.
<ul>
<li>Gain</li>
<li>Insertion loss/phase</li>
<li>Electrical length/delay and group delay</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reflection - refers to the stimulus signal being reflected back from the DUT rather than traveling through it.</li>
</ol>
