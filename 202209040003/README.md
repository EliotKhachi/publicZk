# Connected Components in an Undirected Graph 

Connected components in an undirected graph are a collection of nodes wherein any node can be reached from any other node in the collection.

## Example
```python
1 <--> 2 <--> 3 <--> 4 <--> 5 # connected components in an undirected graph
6 <--> 7 <--> 8 <--> 9 <--> 10 # another set of connected components
```
In the above example, we have two sets of connected components because nodes 6-10 cannot be reached by 1-5, nor vice versa.
