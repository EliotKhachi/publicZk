# Number Systems

The number system we're all familiar with is decimal: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This counting system is in *Base 10*.  

What does that mean?

It means that for any number, each digit is multiplied by 10^n and added to gether to give you the total value of that number, where `n` is the digit's *place* starting at 0 from the right.  

## Example
18 = 8 * 10^0 + 1 * 10^1
256 = 6 * 10^0 + 5 * 10^1 + 2 * 10^2
100001 = 1 * 10^0 + 0 * 10^1 + 0 * 10^2 + 0 * 10^3 + 0 * 10^4 + 1 * 10^5
