# Introduction to NGINX

*NGINX*, pronounced as Engine-X, is a free and open-source web server software that handles reverse proxies and balances load on those proxies.

## Commands
```bash
	sudo apt install nginx -y
	sudo systemctl start nginx # start service
	sudo systemctl stop nginx # stop service  
	sudo systemctl status nginx # see service status  
	sudo systemctl enable nginx # auto start when Linux server is rebooted	
	sudo systemctl disable nginx # disable auto start  
	sudo systemctl restart nginx # restart service 
	sudo systemctl reload nginx # reload config settings without restarting 

```
