# Software Design Patterns

A *software design pattern* is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occuring problem within a given context in software design.  

Patterns make it easier for two developers to communicate with each other because complex information is delivered with a single name. Patterns are a form of mental chunking.  

## Examples
One form of a software design pattern is the repository pattern used in the data access layer. [202209172354](../202209172354) - Repository Pattern
