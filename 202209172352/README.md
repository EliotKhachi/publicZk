# Software Design Patterns 

A *software design pattern* is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occuring problem within a given context in software design.  

Patterns make it easier for two developers to communicate with each other because complex information is delivered with a single name. Patterns are a form of mental chunking.  

## Examples
One example of a software design pattern is the use of a repository in the data access layer. [202209172354](../202209172354) - Repository 

Another example of a software design pattern is the type of application known as CRUD. [202209180027](../202209180027) - CRUD
