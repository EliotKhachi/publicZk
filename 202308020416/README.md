# I am not my past nor my current circumstance

We all have encountered trauma to some degree in our lives, but we don't have to let it define us. Similarly, we aren't our jobs, status, nor our wealth.  

Then who are we? Who am I?

I choose identify as pure awareness and the spirit of transformation. I have the power to become whoever I want.
