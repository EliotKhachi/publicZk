# Spring Web MVC 

*Spring Web MVC* is a web framework built on the Servlet API.  

Here is how it works:
A central `Servlet`, the `DispatcherServlet`, provides a shared algorithm for request processing while actual work is performed by configurable delgate components. The `DispatcherServlet` is registered and initialized by the `web.xml` file.  


The Spring MVC is flexible and supports diverse workflows.
