        <p><strong>Please highlight your experience developing low latency code in C and C++</strong><br />
        Although I haven't developed low latency code in C or C++, I have developed such code in MATLAB, a syntactically similar language, and I am familiar with C concepts such as pointers from my personal studies.</p>
        <p>Specifically, I programmed a fluid dynamics simulation in MATLAB to solve the 2D lid-driven square cavity problem. The purpose of the project was to visualize how the velocity gradient of the fluid inside the cavity changes over time when a lid is dragged over it. I first derived finite difference formulations of the Navier Stokes equations for incompressible, rotational, and viscous fluid in the x, y, and time components. Next, I initialized a grid to mesh the cavity and selected a time step. At each time step, I traversed the grid in a breadth-first-search fashion, computing the temperature of each cell. The temperature of each cell is a function of the neighboring cells. The simulation produces a colorized video plot of the velocity gradient.</p>
        <p><strong>If you possess any experience with real time communication protocols and audio/video processing, please identify.</strong> I am familiar with the serial communication protocols SPI and I2C. I wrote C code in the Arduino IDE that read sensor data through the I2C communication protocol and rendered graphics onto an LCD display to emulate an Flight Instrument display, the thing pilots use while they're flying an airplane to view critical flight information. I read data from the MPU-6050, a 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyroscope sensor, to determine the velocity and orientation of the "aircraft". The velocity was printed onto the display, while the orientation was broken into pitch, yaw, and roll components and then visualized as a horizon on the display. The display also printed temperature and pressure readings from other sensors using the I2C protocol.</p>
        <p><strong>Have you worked with connecting APIs for media infra/platforms?</strong> I do not have experience connecting APIs for media infra/platforms but I have developed a RESTful API and basic front-end as part of a web development course. The application was used to create, read, update, and delete "bug sightings". A bug sighting consists of a category title, description, image url, and date of the sighting. The course exposed me to software principles and best practices as they pertain to web development. The technologies I used include but are not limited to: Java Spring Boot, React, Docker, and MySQL.</p>
        <p><strong>Do you have familiarity with system programming concepts and multithreading?</strong> I do have familiarity with multi-threading and other system programming concepts.</p>
        <p>Multi-threaded applications execute tasks in parallel. Single-threaded applications execute tasks sequentially. Multi-threaded applications harness the power of parallel processing to improve performance, but not without complicating things. Careless implementations of multi-threading result in data corruption or application deadlocking. Data corruption occurs when threads attempt to access the same memory location simultaneously. This is avoided by carefully imposing and releasing locks on threads when critical sections of code are being executed. However, if these locks are not released timely, then the process can be halted due to unavailable threads, thereby deadlocking the application.</p>
        <p>I am also familiar with setting up networks and security measures. I am hosting a public personal website on an AWS EC2 instance, the DNS settings of which are configured with AWS Route 53 to point to my google domain. Furthermore, I am hosting another web app by port forwarding my home router to a raspberry pi. I am using the pi to control my AquaLink pool &amp; spa over the internet. As a security measure, the web app requires a login to authenticate the user before accessing the controls. The pi communicates with the pool &amp; spa control panel through an RS485 cable (much credit deserved by <a href="https://github.com/sfeakes/AqualinkD">https://github.com/sfeakes/AqualinkD</a>).</p>
