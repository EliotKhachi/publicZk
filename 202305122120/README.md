# Logic Gates 

A logic gate is a circuit that takes input signals as HIGH or LOW and generates HIGH or LOW output. [HIGH and LOW Voltages](../202305121857)  

See [Logic Operators](../202305122125) for different types of logic gates.  

Note that when an input of a logic gate is not connected to HIGH or LOW, then the gate doesn't know what value to assign to that input. You will get strange outcomes, so be sure to address it [Floating pins ](../202110192017).
