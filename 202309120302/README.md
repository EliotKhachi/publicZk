# Amazon EFS

Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is a serverless, fully elastic network file system (NFS) that can be mounted on 100s of EC2s across [Availability Zones](../202309120416). It automatically grows and shrinks as you add and remove files with no need for management, provisioning, deploying, patching, or maintenance.
