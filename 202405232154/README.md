# How to Pitch Your Seed Stage

Stand out by being concise and easy to understand instead of sounding salesy and fancy. If the investor doesn't understand you, then they aren't going to invest.  

## The Pitch
**Template** 
First slide - What do you do? Give 2 sentences and give an example of a user using your product.  
Last slide -  What are you asking for?
Other slides (in order of impressiveness. Each slide should earn your next 2 minutes):  
* Team  
* Traction  
* What do you know that others don't or disagree with?  
* Market size

**Common Mistakes**  
* Pitching investors like they're customers. Don't use user jargon with investors. Keep it simple.   
* Trying to be 100% accurate. Don't sacrifice clarity for more information or accuracy.  
* Example is too general
* Example does not illustrate the problem / solution  
* Not confirming the investor understands the basics before moving onto charts/numbers  
* Not ordering points from most to least impressive  
* Treating a pitch like a book report. (start a conversation, let investors talk/comment/ask)  
* Not paying attention to the investor  
* Distracting slides  

## Team
Cofounders, credentials, impressive accomplishments, and if possible how you've experienced the problem. Come off as the experts.  
**Common Mistakes** 
* them your life story.  
* Not telling them your impressive accomplishments.  

## Traction
Talk about what you've done since you've started and why it's impressive.  
Don't put a bad, fake traction slide (advisors, surveys) if you don't have any. 

## What Do You Know That Others Don't
**The investor should know what you do and be impressed by the team by this point. Otherwise this slide is useless**  
AirBNB: All other marketplaces that list timeshares of living spaces do not facilitate payments. There's a huge potential market if a 3rd party can come in and facilitate the transaction because the tenant and home owner can trust that 3rd party more than they trust each other.  
**Common Mistakes**
No unique insights. No specific example of a user using your product. Not using numbers/facts.  

## Market Size
The final number is not important. The important thing is how you got to that number. Do market research and a bottom-up calculation of number of potential users x how much you can charge them and why.  
**Common Mistakes**  
* Quoting some report  
* Not showing the math  
* Not talking about comparable products  

## Ask
How much are you raising and what is the milestone this investment will help you achieve.  
3 types of investors:  
1. I will never fund this company.  
2. I will definitely fund this company.  
3. If they ask me, it will be uncomfortable to say no, so I will write them a check.  
**Common Mistakes**  
* Not asking for money  
* Not talking about social proof  
* Talking about who you will hire  
* Not talking about revenue / usage milestone in a certain timeframe
