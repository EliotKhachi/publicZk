<h1 id="i2c-clock-line-scl">I2C Clock Line: SCL</h1>
<p>SCL is one of the two open-drain, bidirectional lines of the I2C bus. It is responsible for establishing the speed of the communication, i.e. the frequency at which bits are “sent” through the SDA line. <a href="../202305300022/README.md">Clock Bus</a></p>
<p>Not all devices can be operated at all speeds, but devices are downward-compatible. However, the latter is not true for ultra fast-mode devices because an ultra-fast bus is unidirectional while the other modes are bidirectional.</p>
