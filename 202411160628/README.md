# MBSE Case Studies

## Pre-requisites
* Well documented org-wide SE processes  
* Defined processes for model management  
* Investment in full-scale MBSE tools  

## Key Findings
* Lack of skilled / trained MBSE engineers was a major hindrance to successful implementation  
* MBSE helped detect and therefore prevent system defects earlier  
* MBSE enhanced requirement completeness and consistency  

## Qualitative Measurements

1. Generic claims of program improvement (52% of case studies)
2. Generic claims of technical improvement (51%)
3. Improved control of complexity (13%)
4. Improved communication (24%)
5. Ensured consistency (24%)
6. Ensured completeness of requirements (24%)
7. Ensured completeness of other design aspects (21%)
8. Maintained currency in model artifacts (6%)
9. Enabled reuse of designs and design information (10%)
10. Improved ability to address stakeholder diversity (7%)

## Quantitative Measurements
1. Reductions in defect rates or prevention of rework (47% of case studies with metrics)
2. Reductions in cost and schedule (38%)
3. Control of requirements, complexity or risk (14%, without defining corresponding impact on defects or costs)
4. Systems engineering effort compared to total project effort
5. Project performance correlated with systems engineering capability
6. Cost committed vs. cost expended across project lifecycle
7. Impact of requirements volatility on systems engineering effort
8. Cost to fix defects in different project phases
9. Part growth after system design review
10. Automated error tracking results
11. Reduction in systems engineering labor
12. Probabilities of project success with MBSE implementation
13. Return on investment for developing custom MBSE approaches
