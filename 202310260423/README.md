*A Practical Guide to SysML* by Sanford Friedenthal, Alan Moore, and Rick Steiner teaches readers what [SysML](../202110032315) is and how it is employed in [Model-Based Systems Engineering](../202110052023).  

The book starts by providing an overview of systems engineering, MBSE, and the SysML architecture. It then describes the concepts of the language. Finally, the book provides examples of complex systems and how they are described in the language.
