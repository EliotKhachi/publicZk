<h1 id="i2c-open-drain">I2C Open-Drain</h1>
<p><em>Open-Drain</em> is a type of output driver used by the I2C bus lines (SCL and SDA) where each line is pulled up to VCC with a resistor externally.</p>
<p>This causes the default state for each line to be HIGH when the open-drain driver is turned off.</p>
