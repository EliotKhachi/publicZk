# Production Rules

A production rule, or production, is a *rewrite rule* that specifies a symbol substitution. Each rule has a *head*, or left-hand side, which consists of the string that can be replaced, and a *body*, or right hand-side, which consists of the string that may replace it. The head must be a [NonTerminal Symbols](../202402070624), while the body may consist of a combination of [Terminal Symbols](../202402070511) and nonterminal symbols and/or terminal strings.
