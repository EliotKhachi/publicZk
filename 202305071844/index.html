<h1 id="resistor">Resistor</h1>
<h2 id="what">What</h2>
<p>A resistor is a block of material with two wires sticking out.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>Resistors add resistance to a circuit . They’re used to control how much current flows through a circuit at any given location. <a href="../202305080058">Circuit Design, Build, and Measuring!</a></p>
<p>We must control the amount of current circuits to provide the components just the right amount of power; too much and they burn, too little and they can’t perform their function.</p>
<h2 id="how">How</h2>
<p>A resistor’s resistance value depends on the material composition of the block between its wires. They come in a range of varying resistance values, which can be discerned by the color bands on the block <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=resistor+color+code+chart&amp;t=newext&amp;atb=v344-1&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images&amp;iai=https%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-FHlvZOYyT7M%2FXnDvoCRj6lI%2FAAAAAAAAATI%2FrKA6gHlUJ8I2263rZBzZsA4f4ejv1JPSgCEwYBhgL%2Fs1600%2FFive%252BBand%252BResistor%252BColour%252BCode.png">Resistor Color Code Chart</a></p>
