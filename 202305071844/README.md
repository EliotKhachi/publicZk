# Resistor 

## What
A resistor is a block of material with two wires sticking out.   

## Why
Resistors add resistance to a circuit . They're used to control how much current flows through a circuit at any given location. [Circuit Design, Build, and Measuring!](../202305080058)

We must control the amount of current circuits to provide the components just the right amount of power; too much and they burn, too little and they can't perform their function.  

## How
A resistor's resistance value depends on the material composition of the block between its wires. They come in a range of varying resistance values, which can be discerned by the color bands on the block [Resistor Color Code Chart](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=resistor+color+code+chart&t=newext&atb=v344-1&iax=images&ia=images&iai=https%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-FHlvZOYyT7M%2FXnDvoCRj6lI%2FAAAAAAAAATI%2FrKA6gHlUJ8I2263rZBzZsA4f4ejv1JPSgCEwYBhgL%2Fs1600%2FFive%252BBand%252BResistor%252BColour%252BCode.png)
