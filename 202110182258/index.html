<h1 id="a-rule-in-a-makefile">A Rule in a Makefile</h1>
<p>A <em>rule</em> in a makefile explains how and when to remake certain files which are the <em>targets</em> of the particular rule. Rules can also explain how and when to carry out an action. A makefile may contain other text besides rules but a simple makefile need only contain rules.</p>
