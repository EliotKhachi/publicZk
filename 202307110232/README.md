# Coaching Session for the Avoidant Attachment Style

1. Learn to identify deactivating strategies.   
2. De-emphasize self-reliance and focus on mutual support.  
3. Find a secure partner.  
4. Be aware of your tendency to misinterpret behaviors.  
5. Make a relationships gratitude list.  
6. Accept that your ex-partner is not and never was a viable option.  
7. Forget about "the one". There are many potential soul mates in the world.  
8. Adopt the distraction strategy (it's easier to get close to your partner if there's a distraction involved).
