# Agile Software Development 

Agile software development is a project management approach that emphasizes small, fast product improvements and ultimately satisfying the customer rather than strictly following a plan or meeting requirements.  

## 4 Values
**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools  
**Working software** over comprehensive documentaton  
**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  
**Responding to change** over following a plan  

Which is not to say that the items on the right have no value. The items on the left are simply valued more.  

## 12 Principles
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.  
2. Requirements can always change.  
3. Deliver working software frequently.  
4. Business people and developers collaborate daily throughout the project.  
5. Trust individuals to get the job done.  
6. Face-to-face conversation is the most effective form of communication.  
7. Progress is primarily measured by working sofwtware.   
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development, enabling an indefinite constant pace.   
9. Attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.  
10. Simplicity is essential.  
11. Self-organizing teams create the best architectures, requirements, and designs.   
12. Retrospect regularly on how the team can become more effective.
