<p>Amazon EBS volumes are “network” USB sticks. Multiple EBS volumes can be attached and mounted to a single instance as long as they are in the same AZ [<a href="../202309120416">Availability Zone</a>].</p>
<p>Amazon EFS is a network file system (NFS) that stretches across AZs. 100s of EC2 instances can mount the same EFS to sync files between them.</p>
<p>Amazon Instance Store is an allocation of physical storage resources right onto your instance. It’s used to store data locally for operations such as caching to improve performance.</p>
<p>EFS is more expensive than EBS.</p>
