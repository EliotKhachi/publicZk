<h1 id="the-abundance-mindset">The Abundance Mindset</h1>
<p>The <em>abundance mindset</em> is in direct opposition to <a href="../202308040127/README.md">The Scarcity Mindset</a>. It is a cooperative frame of viewing the world wherein there is enough to go around for everyone. This mindset is associated with being in a state of love. You view people around you as friends and allies.<br />
## Material Abundance The world is a positive-sum game. You are satisfied with what you have and can attain whatever you desire. The people around you are there to help you fulfill your desires and needs, and achieve your goals– and you theirs.</p>

<p>In <em>Man’s Search for Meaning</em>, Viktor Frankl spoke about his experience, and that of his fellow prisoners, in Nazi concentration camps. He described the psychological progression of letting go of your desires– from the moment the officers strip you of your possessions to being entrenched in daily camp life. Things that you thought you couldn’t live without, you simply let go of, along with a part of your perceived identity. Even when the needs of the prisoners were taken away and they were pushed to the brink of death, they clung onto hope, the will to live, the <em>the search for meaning</em>, and through it all, they still found joy and laughter.</p>
<p>Despite living in complete scarcity, the prisoners experienced glimpses of the abundance mindset. This means that you can have an abundance mindset regardless of your current circumstances.</p>
