# The Abundance Mindset
The abundance mindset is in direct opposition to [The Scarcity Mindset](../202308040127/README.md). It is a cooperative frame of viewing the world wherein there is enough to go around for everyone. This mindset is associated with being in a state of love. You view people around you as friends and allies.  
## Material Abundance
The world is a positive-sum game. You are satisfied with what you have and can attain whatever you desire. The people around you are there to help you achieve your goals and you theirs.
