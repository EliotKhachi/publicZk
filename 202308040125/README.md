# The Abundance Mindset
The *abundance mindset* is in direct opposition to [The Scarcity Mindset](../202308040127/README.md). It is a cooperative frame of viewing the world wherein there is enough to go around for everyone. This mindset is associated with being in a state of love. You view people around you as friends and allies.  
## Material Abundance
The world is a positive-sum game. You are satisfied with what you have and can attain whatever you desire. The people around you are there to help you fulfill your desires and needs, and achieve your goals-- and you theirs.  

## Spiritual Abundance
*in work...*  

In *Man's Search for Meaning*, Viktor Frankl spoke about his experience, and that of the prisoners, in Nazi concentration camps. He described the psychological progression of letting go of your desires-- from the moment the officers strip you of your possessions upon being admitted to the camp to being entrenched in daily camp life. Things that you thought you couldn't live without, you simply let go of, along with a part of your perceived identity. Even when your needs were taken away from you and you were pushed to the brink of death, you clung onto hope, the will to live, *the search for meaning*. Through all of this, the prisoners even found joy and laughter at times.
