# The Abundance Mindset
The abundance mindset is in direct opposition to [The Scarcity Mindset](../202308040127/README.md). It is a cooperative frame of viewing the world wherein there is enough to go around for everyone. This mindset is associated with being in a state of love.  
## Material Abundance
You are satisfied with what you have and can attain whatever it is you desire. You view people around you as allies that help you attain your goals and whom you help attain their goals. You are at ease and in control.
