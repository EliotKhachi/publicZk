# The Abundance Mindset

The *abundance mindset* is in direct opposition to [The Scarcity Mindset](../202308040127/README.md). It is a cooperative frame of viewing the world wherein there is enough to go around for everyone. Whatever it is you desire, you may have and more.  

This mindset is associated with being in a state of love because you view people around you as allies. Allies that help you attain your goals and whom you help attain their goals. You're constantly giving or receiving love. You are at ease and in control.
