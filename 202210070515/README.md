# Streams 

## Concept

A **stream** is an abstraction for a potentially infinite sequence of bytes, with a direction. There are two directions:  

1. An **input** stream is an infinite sequence of bytes that we can read.  

2. An **output** stream is an infinite sequence of bytes to which we can write.

## What Are Streams REALLY?

* Bytes read from and written to files are streams.  
* Bytes sent and received on a network are streams.  
* Bytes sent and received in the console are streams.  
* `System.in` is the standard input stream, `System.out` is the standard output stream.
