# Streams

Bytes read from and written to files are streams.  

A **stream** is an abstraction for a potentially infinite sequence of bytes, with a direction. There are two directions:  

1. An **input** stream is an infinite sequence of bytes that we can read.  

2. An **output** stream is an infinite sequence of bytes to which we can write.
