<p>A <strong>stream</strong> is an abstraction for a potentially infinite sequence of bytes, with a direction. There are two directions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>An <strong>input</strong> stream is an infinite sequence of bytes that we can read.</p></li>
<li><p>An <strong>output</strong> stream is an infinite sequence of bytes to which we can write.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-are-streams-really">What Are Streams REALLY?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bytes read from and written to files are streams.<br />
</li>
<li>Bytes sent and received on a network are streams.<br />
</li>
<li>Bytes sent and received in the console are streams.<br />
</li>
<li><code>System.in</code> is the standard input stream, <code>System.out</code> is the standard output stream.</li>
</ul>
