# Use STM32 HAL libraries to read and write data via I2C

HAL I2C Master Transmit/Receive functions are used to write data to and read data from slave devices that have a single register for R/W, respectively. 

HAL I2C Mem Read/Write functions are used with slave devices that have multiple registers. With these devices, you need to specify the register address you are referring to as a function parameter.
