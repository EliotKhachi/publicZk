# Use STM32 HAL libraries to read and write data via I2C

[HAL I2C Transmit & Receive Functions](../202306112227/README.md) are used to write data to and read data from slave devices that have a single register for R/W, respectively. 

[HAL I2C Mem Read & Write Functions](../202306112231/README.md) are used with slave devices that have multiple registers. With these devices, you need to specify the register address you are referring to as a function parameter.
