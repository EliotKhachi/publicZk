<h1 id="types-of-http-requests">Types of HTTP Requests</h1>
<p>There are commonly 9 different types of HTTP request methods.</p>
<h2 id="get">GET</h2>
<p>A read operation. These requests only retrieve data. The client cannot send data with this request.<br />
## HEAD Identical to <code>GET</code> except the response body is ommitted. Used to troubleshoot HTTP response codes and errors.<br />
## POST A create operation. Could also be used to update data. Client may send data with the request.<br />
## PUT An update/replace operation. Client may send data with the request.<br />
## DELETE A delete operation.<br />
## CONNECT Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource. Can be used to upgrade from HTTP to HTTPS.<br />
## OPTIONS Describes the communication options for the target resource.<br />
## TRACE Performs a message loop-back test. Echoes the request the server received. Useful to check networks with intermediary nodes where the request gets modified along the way.<br />
## PATCH A partial update operation.</p>
