# How Web Servers Work

At a fundamental level, your web browser displays content on your computer screen. The purpose of a web server is to store that content and transfer it upon request (to the *client*).  

Whenever a browser needs a file that is hosted on a web server, the browser requests the file via HTTP. When the request reaches the correct web server (hardware), the HTTP server (software) accepts the request, finds the requested document, and sends it back to the browser, also through HTTP.
