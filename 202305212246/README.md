# Mastering Linux

The power of linux comes from the shell and its commands. Mastery of the shell requires a fundamental understanding of how inputs, outputs, and errors work when using commands.  

[What is a Command?](../202305212316/README.md)

## Inputs
You can provide input
1. From your keyboard --> [Standard Input](../202305212202/README.md).  
2. From a file --> [Redirecting Standard Input](../202305212146/README.md)  

## Outputs
The output can be
1. Printed onto your terminal --> [Standard Output](../202305212216/README.md)  
2. Written to a file --> [Redirecting Standard Output](../202305212218/README.md)  

## Errors
Errors can be  
1. Printed onto your terminal --> [Standard Error](../202305212230/README.md)  
2. Written to a file --> [Redirecting Standard Error](../202305212235/README.md)
