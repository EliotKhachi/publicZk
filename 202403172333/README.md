# Amazon S3 Security

You can control permissions on an S3 bucket on a user basis or a resource basis:  

1. User-Based - use IAM policies to control which API calls should be allowed for a specific user.  
2. Resource-Based  
* Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules; allows cross account (most common)  
* Object Access Control List (ACL) - finer grain (less common)  
* Bucket Access Control List (ACL) - bucket wide rules; (least common)
