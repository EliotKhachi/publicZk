# Inner Energy or Chakra

Chakras are energy centers in our body. The amount of inner energy stored in our chakras is nearly limitless, and this is the energy we need to thrive.  

Chakras affect our physical and emotional well-being, and unblocking them leads to enthusiasm, joy, and love. Through practices such as yoga, meditation, and breathing exercises, we can learn to unblock our chakras.
