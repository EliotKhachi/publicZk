<p>Chakras are energy centers in our body. The amount of inner energy stored in our chakras is nearly limitless, and this is the energy we need to thrive.</p>
<p>Chakras affect our physical and emotional well-being, and unblocking them leads to enthusiasm, joy, and love. Through practices such as yoga, meditation, and breathing exercises, we can learn to unblock our chakras.</p>
